In the section "To The Reader" our author writes:

_There be, no doubt, some faults committed by the =Printer=, both
Literall and Materiall, and some Errors of the =Gravers= in the
=Figures=, (as in the =Tetragrammaton=; in the Figure of =Arîon=; and
in the =Proprieties= due to some other =Hieroglyphicks=); but, for the
most part, they are such, as =Common-Readers= will never perceive; and
I thinke, that they who are =Judicious= will so plainly finde them to
be no faults of mine; that, leaving them to be amended by those, to
whom they appertaine; and, =You=, to accept of these =Play-games= as
you please: I bid you =Farewell=._

Therefore all oddities and inconsistencies have been left unchanged.
They have been noted at the end of the transcription.

An addendum of transcriptions and translations of the mottoes engraved
around each emblem has been added to the final note as a convenience to
the reader.




A PREPOSITION to this FRONTISPIECE.


    This BOOKE contayning EMBLEMS, ’twas thought fit,
    A _Title-page_ should stand to usher it,
    That’s Emblematicall: And, for that end,
    Our AVTHOR, to the _Graver_ did commend
    A plaine Invention; that it might be wrought,
    According as his Fancie had forethought.
    Insteed thereof, the _Workeman_ brought to light,
    What, here, you see; therein, mistaking quite
    The true _Designe_: And, so (with paines, and cost)
    The first intended FRONTISPIECE, is lost.
      The AVTHOR, was as much displeas’d, as Hee
    In such Adventures, is inclin’d to bee;
    And, halfe resolv’d, to cast this PIECE aside,
    As nothing worth: but, having better ey’d
    Those _Errors_, and _Confusions_, which may, there,
    Blame-worthy (at the first aspect) appeare;
    Hee saw, they fitted many Fantasies
    Much better, then what _Reason_ can devise;
    And, that, the _Graver_ (by meere _Chance_) had hit
    On what, so much transcends the reach of _Wit_,
    As made it seeme, an Object of _Delight_,
    To looke on what, MISFORTVNE brought to light:
    And, here it stands, to try his _Wit_, who lists
    To pumpe the secrets, out of _Cabalists_.
      If any thinke this _Page_ will, now, declare
    The meaning of those _Figures_, which are there,
    They are deceiv’d. For, _Destinie_ denyes
    The utt’ring of such hidden _Mysteries_,
    In these respects: First, _This_ contayneth nought
    Which (in a proper sense) concerneth, ought,
    The _present-Age_: Moreover, tis ordain’d,
    That, none must know the _Secrecies_ contain’d
    Within this PIECE; but, they who are so wise
    To finde them out, by their owne _prudencies_;
    And, hee that can unriddle them, to us,
    Shall stiled be, the second OEDIPVS.
      Tis, likewise, thought expedient, now and then,
    To make some _Worke_, for those _All-knowing men_,
    (To exercise upon) who thinke they see
    The _secret-meanings_, of all things that bee.
      And, lastly, since we finde, that, some there are,
    Who best affect _Inuentions_, which appeare
    Beyond their understandings; _This_, we knew
    A _Representment_, worthy of their view;
      And, here, wee placed it, to be, to these,
      A FRONTISPIECE, in any sense they please.

                                   A
                          WRIT OF PREVENTION
                  Concerning the AVTHORS _Dedication_
                of the foure following BOOKES, to those
          _Royall_, _Princely_, and _Illustrious_ PERSONAGES,
                       whose Names are mentioned
                           in this _Leafe_.

    I have not often us’d, with _Epigrames_,
    Or, with _Inscriptions_ unto many NAMES,
    To charge my _Bookes_: Nor, had I done it, now,
    If I, to pay the _Duties_ which I owe,
    Had other _meanes_; Or, any better Wayes
    To honour them, whose _Vertue_ merits praise.
      In _ARCHITECT_, it giveth good content,
    (And passeth for a praisefull _Ornament_)
    If, to adorne the _FORE-FRONTS_, _Builders_ reare
    The _Statues_ of their _Soveraigne-Princes_, there;
    And, trimme the _Outsides_, of the other SQVARES
    With _Portraitures_ of some Heroicke PEERES.
      If, therefore, I (the more to beautifie
    This _Portion_ of my MVSES _Gallerie_)
    Doe, here, presume to place, the _NAMES_ of those
    To whose _Deserts_, my LOVE remembrance owes,
    I hope ’twill none offend. For, most, who see
    Their worthy _mention_, in this BOOKE, to bee,
    Will thinke them honor’d: And, perhaps, it may
    (To their high praise) be found, another day,
    That, in these LEAVES their _Names_ wil stand unrac’d,
    When many fairer _STRVCTVRFS_, are defac’d.

    _In this =Hope=, I have placed on the FORE-FRONT (or before the
    =First Booke= of these EMBLEMS) a =Ioint-Inscription= to the
    KING and QVEENES most excellent MAIESTIE._

    _Upon the =Right-Side-Front= of this =Building= (or before
    the =Second Booke=) One =Inscription= to the most hopefull
    =Prince, =CHARLES=, Prince of =Wales=; And, another to his deere
    =Brother, =IAMES=, Duke of =Yorke=, =&c.=_

    _On the other =Side-Front=, (or before the =Third Booke=)
    One =Inscription= to the gratious Princesse, FRANCES
    Dutchesse-Dowager of RICHMOND and LENOX; And, another to her
    most noble Nephew, IAMES Duke of Lenox, &c._

    _On the =Fourth Front= of our =Square=, (Or before the =Fourth
    Booke=) One =Inscription= to the right Honourable PHILIP Earle
    of =Pembrooke= and =Montgomery=, &c. And another to the right
    Honourable, HENRY Earle of =Holland=, &c._


                       To the MAJESTIE of Great
               _Britaine_, _France_, and _Ireland_, the
                        Most Illustrious King,
                               CHARLES;
                And his excellently beloved, the most
                        gratious _Queene_ MARY.

    Sev’n yeares are full expired, Royall SIR,
    Since last I kneel’d, an offring to preferre
    Before your feete; where, now, my selfe I throw
    To pay once more, the _Tributes_ which I owe.
      _As many yeares are past, most beauteous QVEENE,
    Since witnesses, mine eares and eyes, have beene
    Of those Perfections; which the generall =Fame=
    Hath sounded forth, in honour of your =Name=._
      And, both your _beaming-splendors_ (oh yee faire,
    Thrice blessed, and most fitly-matched PAIRE)
    Vpon each other, make such bright reflections;
    And have so sweetly mingled your _affections_,
    Your _Praise_, your _Pow’re_, your _Vertues_, and your _Beautie_:
    That, (if preserving of my _Soveraigne dutie_,
    This may be said) you doe appeare, to me,
    TWO PERSONS, in One MAIESTY, to be;
    To whom, there, appertaines (in veneration
    Of your large _Worth_) the right of some _Oblation_
    And, best, I thought, my _Homage_ would be done,
    If, thus, the tender were to BOTH-in-ONE.
    Which, in this humble GVIFT, my _Love_ presents;
    And, wisheth it may adde to your Contents.
      Perhaps it shall: For, though I dare not shew
    These _Figures_, as well meriting your view;
    Nor boast, as if their _Moralls_ couched ought,
    By which your sacred _Wisdomes_ may be taught:
    Yet, I have humble _Hopings_, that, they might
    Prove, some way, an occasion of delight;
    Since, meane and common _Objects_, now and then,
    Beget contentments in the _greatest-men_.
      But, that before this _Booke_, I should propose
    Your praisefull NAMES, there is (as I suppose)
    A faire inducement: For, considering these
    Are EMBLEMS, whose intention is to please
    And profit vulgar Iudgements (by the view,
    Of what they ought to follow, or eschew.)
    And, I well knowing, that your MAIESTIES
    Set foorth before my _Booke_, in _Emblem-wise_,
    Throughout your Lands, more _Vertues_ might convay,
    Than many _Volumes_, of these _Emblems_, may;
    It seemed _Petty-treason_, to omit
    This good occasion of endeavouring it.
    For, (if your MAIESTIES, well heeded, were)
    YOV, double-treble-foure-fold _Emblems_ are;
    Which, fully to illustrate, would require
    The _Wit_ I want; or, meanes to raise, that, higher
    Which I have gain’d; (and, which, as yet, hath flowne
    By no incouragements, but by her owne.)
      Of all the _Vertues_ OECONOMICAL,
    Of _Duties_ MORAL and POLITICALL,
    Your _Lives_ are _Patternes_, and faire EMBLEMS; whether
    Considered apart, or both together.
      Your CHILDHOODS were bright _Mirrours_, which did show
    What Duties, _Children_, to their _Parents_ owe:
    And, by the sequele, we now understand,
    That, they who best _obay’d_, can best command.
    The glorious _Vertues_ of your NVPTIALL-_state_,
    Your _Courtiers_, find so hard to imitate,
    That, they admire them, rather; and would sweare,
    (Had others told, what, now they see and heare)
    That, all the former Times, were not acquainted,
    With such a _Paire_, when _Kings_ and _Queenes_ were _Sainted_.
    The chastest _Cupids_, and the gamesom’st _Graces_,
    Are alwaies mingled in your _Deare-embraces_.
    The mutuall enterchanges of your _Loves_,
    May teach affection to the _Turtle-doves_:
    And, such as are, with goodly sights, delighted,
    May see in _You_, all _Excellence_ united.
      You, SIR, who beare _Ioves_ Thunders in your Fist,
    And, (shake this _Ilands_ EMPIRE, when You list)
    Did never in your _Orbe_, a _Tempest_ move,
    But, by the Beautious _Mistresse_ of your _Love_
    It might be calm’d. _And, in your lofty =Spheare=,
    Most lovely QVEENE, Your Motions ever, were
    So smoath, and, so direct; that, none can say,
    They have withdrawne his Royall-heart away
    From Iust =Designes=; Which, loudly speakes your =Praise=,
    And, intimates much more, than, yet, it saies._
      Yea, both Your _Splendors_ doe so glorious growe,
    And, You, each other have out-vyed so,
    In these, and other _Vertues_; that, on You,
    Should I conferre what praise, I thinke, is due,
    My _Lines_, (which from that staine have, yet, beene cleare)
    Would Flatt’ry seeme, unto an envious eare.
      But, what needs _Flatt’ry_, where the _Truth_ may teach
    To praise, beyond immodest _Flatt’ries_ reach?
    Or, what needs he to feare a _sland’rous-mouth_,
    Who seekes no _meed_, nor utters more than Truth?
      Your Princely _Vertues_, what can better show,
    Than _Peace_, and _Plenty_, which have thrived so,
    Whilst You have raign’d that, yet, no people see,
    A _Richer_, or more _Peacefull_ time, than wee?
    Your _Civill Actions_ (to the publike eye)
    Are faire _examples_ of _Moralitie_,
    So manifest; That, if he Truth did sing,
    Who said, _The World doth imitate the King_;
    My _Muses_ dare, with boldnesse to presage,
    A Chast, a Pious, and a Prosperous _Age_:
    And, that, the stormes which, late, these Realmes deterr’d,
    Shall all be quite removed, or deferr’d
    Till you Ascend; And, future times have seene,
    That, your Examples have not followed beene.
      Thus, you are living _Emblems_, to this _Nation_:
    Which being mark’d with heedefull speculation,
    May serve, as well, to helpe us how to see
    Our _Happinesse_, As, what our _Duties_ be.
      And, if I might unlocke all _Mysteries_,
    Which doe declare, how in a _foure-fold-wise_,
    Your Lives are usefull EMBLEMS; I, perchance,
    Should vexe blind _Zeale_, or anger _Ignorance_;
    And, teach well-temper’d _Spirits_, how to see,
    That, we, for Blessings, oft, Vnthankefull be.
    For, as you, _Both_, Prime _Children_ are of those
    Two _Sister-Churches_, betwixt whom, yet, growes
    Vnseemely _strife_; So, _You_, perhaps, may be
    An _Emblem_, how those MOTHERS may agree.
    And, not by your _Example_, onely, show,
    How wrought it may be; but, effect it so.
    Yea, peradventure, GOD, united _You_,
    That, such a blessed VNION might ensue:
    And, that, Your _living-lovingly_, together;
    Your Christian _hopefullnesse_, of one another;
    Your milde _forbearance_, harsh attempts to proove;
    Your _mutuall-waiting_, untill _God_ shall move
    By some _calme-voice_, or peacefull _inspiration_,
    That _Heart_ Which needeth better _Information_;
    And, that, your _Charities_, might give a _signe_,
    How, all the _Daughters_, of the SPOVSE _Divine_
    Might reconciled be; And, shew, that, _Swords_,
    _Flames_, _Threats_, and _Furie_, make no true _Accords_.
      GOD grant a better VNION may appeare:
    Yet, wish I not the _tollerating_, here,
    Of _Politicke-Agreements_; (further than
    Our wholsome _Lawes_, and, _Civill-vowes_ to man,
    With _Piety_, approve) but, such, as may
    Make up a blessed CONCORD, every way:
    Might it be so; your _Vertues_, would become
    A Glorious _Blessing_, to all CHRISTENDOME:
    Your EMBLEM should, by future _Generations_;
    Be plac’d among the famous _Constellations_,
    And, _after-times_ (though, Mee, this _Age_ despise)
    Would thinke, these _Verses_, had beene _Prophecies_.
      What ever may succeed, my _Pray’rs_ and _Powr’s_
    Are this way bent; with _Hope_, that _You_ or _Yours_
    Shall _Helps_ (at least) become, that _Breach_ to close,
    Which, in the SEAMLES-ROBE, yet, wider growes.
      SO BE IT: And, let bright your _Glories_ bee,
      For ever, though _You_ never shine on MEE.

_Your_ MAIESTIES

      _most Loyall Subject_,

             =GEO: WITHER.=




TO THE READER.


_If there had not beene some =Bookes= conceitedly composed, and sutable
to meane capacities, I am doubtfull, whether I had ever beene so
delighted in reading, as thereby to attaine to the little Knowledge
I have: For, I doe yet remember, that, things =honestly pleasant=,
brought mee by degrees, to love that which is =truely profitable=. And
as =David= said, His =Heart shewed him the wickednesse of the Vngodly=;
(meaning perhaps, that hee felt in himselfe, some =Experiments=, of
the same naturall Corruption, by which they are overcome, who resist
not evill suggestions at their first motions:) Even so, I may truly
acknowledge, that mine owne =Experience= hath showne mee so much of the
common =Ignorance= and =Infirmitie= in mine owne person, that it hath
taught mee, how those things may be wrought upon in others, to their
best advantage._

_Therefore, though I can say no more to disswade from =Vice=, or
to incourage men to =Vertue=, than hath already beene said in many
learned =Authors=; yet I may be an occasion by these =Endeavours=,
to bring that, the oftner into remembrance, which they have, more
learnedly, expressed; and perhaps, by such circumstances, as they would
not descend unto, may insinuate further also with some Capacities,
than more applauded =Meanes=. =Viniger=, =Salt=, or common =Water=,
(which are very meane =Ingredients=) make Sawces more pleasing to some
tastes, than =Sugar=, and =Spices=. In like manner, plaine and vulgar
notions, seasoned with a little =Pleasantnesse=, and relished with a
moderate =Sharpnesse=, worke that, otherwhile, which the most admired
=Compositions= could never effect in many =Readers=; yea, wee have had
frequent proofes, that a blunt =Iest= hath moved to more consideration,
than a judicious =Discourse=._

_I take little pleasures in =Rymes=, =Fictions=, or conceited
=Compositions=, for their owne sakes; neither could I ever take so
much paines, as to spend time to put my meanings into other words than
such as flowed forth, without =Studie=; partly because I delight more
in Matter, than in =Wordy Flourishes=, But, chiefely, because those
=Verball Conceites=, which by some, are accounted most =Elegant=,
are not onely (for the greater part) =Emptie Sounds= and Impertinent
=Clinches=, in themselves; but, such =Inventions=, as do sometime,
also, obscure the =Sense=, to common =Readers=; and, serve to little
other purpose, but for =Wittie men= to shew =Tricks= one to another:
For, the =Ignorant= understand them not; and the =Wise= need them not._

_So much of them, as (without darkning the matter, to them who most
need instruction) may be made use of, to stirre up the =Affections=,
winne =Attention=, or help the =Memory=, I approve and make use of, to
those good purposes, according as my leisure, and the measure of my
=Facultie= will permit; that, =Vanitie= might not, to worse ends, get
them wholly into her =Possession=. For, I know that the meanest of such
conceites are as pertinent to some, as =Rattles=, and =Hobby-horses=
to Children; or as the =A. B. C.= and =Spelling=, were at first to
those =Readers=, who are now past them. And, indeed, to despise =Meane
Inventions=, =Pleasant Compositions=, and =Verball Elegancies=, (being
qualified as is aforesaid) or to banish them out of the world, because
there be other things of more excellencie, were as absurd, as to
neglect and root out all =Herbes=, which will not make =Pottage=; Or,
to destroy all =Flowers=, which are lesse beautifull than the =Tulip=,
or lesse sweet than the =Rose=._

_I (that was never so sullenly wise) have alwaies intermingled
=Sports= with =Seriousnesse= in my =Inventions=; and, taken in
=Verball-conceites=, as they came to hand, without =Affectation=;
But, having, ever aymed, rather to profit my =Readers=, than to gaine
their praise, I never pumpe for those things; and am, otherwhile,
contented to seeme =Foolish=, (yea, and perhaps, more foolish than I
am) to the =Overweening-Wise=; that, I may make others =Wiser than
they were=: And, (as I now doe) am not ashamed to set forth a =Game at
Lots=, or (as it were) a =Puppet-play= in =Pictures=, to allure men
to the more serious observation of the profitable =Morals=, couched
in these =Emblems=. Neverthelesse, (if some have sayd, and thought
truly) my =Poems= have instructed, and rectified many People in the
Course of =Honest-living=, (which is the best =Wisedome=) much more
than the =Austerer Volumes= of some criticall =Authors=; who, are by
the =Common-sort=, therefore onely, judged Wise, because they composed
=Books=, which few understand, save they who need them not._

_In these =Lots= and =Emblems=, I have the same ayme which I had in
my other =Writings=: and, though I have not dressed them sutably to
curious =Fancies=, yet, they yield wholsome nourishment to strengthen
the constitution of a =Good-life=; and, have solidity enough for
a =Play game=, which was but Accidentally composed; and, by this
=Occasion=._

_These =Emblems=, graven in Copper by =Crispinus Passæus= (with a
=Motto= in Greeke, Latine, or Italian, round about every =Figure=;
and with two =Lines= (or =Verses=) in one of the same =Languages=,
periphrasing those =Motto’s=) came to my hands, almost twentie yeares
past. The =Verses= were so meane, that, they were afterward cut off
from the =Plates=; And, the =Collector= of the said Emblems, (whether
hee were the =Versifier= or the =Graver=, was neither so well
advised in the =Choice= of them, nor so exact in observing the true
=Proprieties= belonging to every =Figure=, as hee might have beene._

_Yet, the =Workman-ship= being judged very good, for the most part;
and the rest excusable; some of my Friends were so much delighted
in the =Gravers= art, and, in those =Illustrations=, which for mine
owne pleasure, I had made upon some few of them, that, they requested
mee to =Moralize= the rest. Which I condiscended unto: And, they had
beene brought to view many yeares agoe, but that the =Copper Prints=
(which are now gotten) could not be procured out of =Holland=, upon any
reasonable Conditions._

_If they were worthy of the =Gravers= and =Printers= cost, being
onely dumbe =Figures=, little usefull to any but to young =Gravers=
or =Painters=, and as little delightfull, except, to =Children=,
and =Childish-gazers=: they may now be much more worthy; seeing the
life of =Speach= being added unto them, may make them =Teachers= and
=Remembrancers= of profitable things._

_I doe not arrogate so much unto my =Illustrations=, as to thinke, they
will be able to teach any thing to the =Learned=; yet if they cast
their eyes upon them, perhaps, these =Emblems=, and their =Morals=, may
remember them, either of some =Dutie=, which they might else forget,
or minde them to beware of some =Danger=, which they might otherwise
be unheedfull to prevent. But, sure I am, the =Vulgar Capacities=, may
from them, be many waies both =Instructed=, and =Remembred=; yea, they
that have most need to be =Instructed=, and =Remembred=, (and they who
are most backward to listen to =Instructions=, and =Remembrances=, by

informed of their =Dangers=, or =Duties=, by the way of an honest
=Recreation=, before they be aware._

_For, when levitie, or a childish delight in trifling Objects, hath
allured them to looke on the =Pictures=; Curiositie may urge them to
peepe further, that they might seeke out also their =Meanings=, in
our annexed =Illustrations=; In which, may lurke some =Sentence=, or
=Expression=, so evidently pertinent to their =Estates=, =Persons=, or
=Affections=, as will (at that instant or afterward) make way for those
=Considerations=, which will, at last, wholly change them, or much
better them, in their =Conversation=._

_To seeke out the =Author= of every particular =Emblem=, were a
labour without profit; and, I have beene so far from endeavouring
it, that, I have not so much as cared to find out their meanings in
any of these =Figures=; but, applied them, rather, to such purposes,
as I could thinke of, at first sight; which, upon a second view, I
found might have beene much betterd, if I could have spared time from
other imployments. Something, also, I was =Confined=, by obliging my
selfe to observe the same number of =lines= in every =Illustration=;
and, otherwhile, I was thereby constrained to conclude, when my best
=Meditations= were but new begunne: which (though it hath pleased Some,
by the more comely Vniformitie, in the Pages) yet, it hath much injured
the libertie of my =Muse=._

_There be, no doubt, some faults committed by the =Printer=, both
Literall and Materiall, and some Errors of the =Gravers= in the
=Figures=, (as in the =Tetragrammaton=; in the Figure of =Arîon=; and
in the =Proprieties= due to some other =Hieroglyphicks=; but, for the
most part, they are such, as =Common-Readers= will never perceive; and
I thinke, that they who are =Judicious= will so plainly finde them to
be no faults of mine; that, leaving them to be amended by those, to
whom they appertaine; and, =You=, to accept of these =Play-games= as
you please: I bid you =Farewell=._


            The Occasion, _Intention_, and use of the Foure
               _Lotteries_ adjoyned to these foure Books
                             of _Emblems_.

Stultorum plena sunt omnia. _The world is growne so in Love with
=Follie=, that the Imprinting of over-solid and serious =treatises=
would undoe the Book-sellers; especially, being so chargeable as the
many costly =Sculptures= have made this Booke: therefore, (to advance
their =Profits=, rather than to satisfie my owne =Iudgement=) I was
moved to invent somewhat, which might be likely to please the vulgar
Capacitie, without hindrance to my chiefe =End=. And, though that which
I resolved on, be not so =Plausible= to Criticall understandings, yet
I am contented to hazzard among them, so much of my Reputation as that
comes to._

_I have often observed, that where the =Summer-bowers= of Recreation
are placed neare the =Church=, it drawes thither more people from the
remote =Hamlets=, than would else be there. Now, though I praise not
their =Devotion=, yet I am glad if any thing (which is not evill in
it selfe) may be made an occasion of =Good=: (because, those things
may, perhaps, be continued, at last, for Conscience sake, which were
at first begunne upon vaine =occasions=) and, have therefore added
=Lotteries= to these =Emblems=, to occasion the more frequent notice
of the =Morals=, and good =Counsels= tendred in their =Illustrations=;
hoping that, at one time or other, some shall draw those =Lots=,
which will make them the better, and the happier, whilest they live.
I confesse that this Devise may probably be censured, as unsutable
to the gravitie expected in my ripe yeares: and be reputed as great
an Indecorum, as erecting an =Ale-house= at the =Church-stile=; yet,
the same having had beginning in my younger dayes, I do now resolve
not to be ashamed of it, for the Reasons aforementioned. To such as I
was, it will be someway avayleable: and perhaps, if the =Wisest= did
otherwhile, when they walke abroad, to =Vncertaine purposes=, take
up this =Booke=, and (without =Superstitious Conceites=) make tryall
what their =Lots= would remember, or give them cause to thinke on; it
might, now and then, either occasion better =Proceedings=, or prevent
=Mischieves=._

_Some =Games= were ever in use; ever, I thinke, will be, and for
ought I know, ever may be without exception. And, I believe, this
=Recreation=, will be as harmlesse as any, if it be used according to
my Intentions. For, my meaning is not, that any should use it as an
=Oracle=, which could signifie, infallibly, what is divinely alloted;
but, to serve onely for a =Morall Pastime=. And, that I may no way
encourage the secret entertaining of such a =Fantasie=, I doe before
hand affirme unto them, that none but =Children=, or =Ideots= may be
tollerated to be so foolish, without laughing at._

_Yet, if any one shall draw that =Lot= wherein his =Secret vices=
are reproved; or some good Counsels proposed, which in his owne
understanding are pertinent to his welfare, let not such as =those=,
passe them over as meere =Casualties= to them; for, whatsoever these
=Lots= are to =others=, or in =themselves=, they are to all =these=,
made pertinent in such cases, both by their particular =Knowledges= and
=Occasions=._

_Some will thinke perhaps, that I have purposely invented this =Game=,
that I might finde meanes to reprove mens =vices=, without being
suspected, (as I have hitherto unjustly beene) to ayme at particular
persons: For, if any who are =notoriously Guiltie=, shall by drawing
their =Chances=, among other Companions, be so fitted with =Lots=,
(which may now and then happen) that those =Vices= be therby intimated
to the by-standers, of which the world knowes them guilty; they do
therin make their owne =Libels=; and, may (I hope) bee laughed at
without my blame. If not; I doe here warne all such as are worthily
suspected of =Haynous crimes=, and =Scandalous conversations=, either
to forbeare these =Lotteries=; or to excuse me if they be justly shamed
by their own =Act=._

_Having thus declared the Reason of this =Invention=, and made these
Anticipations; every man hath his choice, whether hee will make use of
those =Lotteries= or no; hee that will, is left to his =Chance=, of
which, how hee shall make tryall, direction is given in the two last
Pages of this =Booke=._

    This _Game_ occasions not the frequent crime,
    Of _Swearing_, or mispending of our _Time_;
    Nor losse of money: For, the _Play_ is _short_,
    And, ev’ry _Gamester_ winneth by the sport.
    Wee, therefore, know it may aswell become
    The _Hall_, the _Parlor_, or the _Dining-roome_,
    As _Chesse_, or _Tables_; and, we thinke the _Price_
    Will be as low; because, it needs no _Dice_.

The AVTHORS Meditation upon sight of his PICTVRE.

    _When I behold my =Picture=, and perceive,
    How vaine it is, our =Portraitures= to leave
    In =Lines=, and =Shadowes=, (which make shewes, to day,
    Of that which will, to morrow, fade away)
    And, thinke, what meane =Resemblances= at best,
    Are by =Mechanike Instruments= exprest;
    I thought it better, much, to leave behind me,
    Some =Draught=, in which, my living friends might find me
    The same I =am=; in =that=, which will remaine,
    Till all is ruin’d, and repair’d againe:
    And, which, in absence, will more truely show me,
    Than, =outward Formes=, to those, who think they know me.
      For, though my gratious MAKER made me such,
    That, where I love, belov’d I am, as much
    As J desire; yet, =Forme=, nor =Features= are,
    Those =Ornaments=, in which J would appeare
    To =future Times=; Though they were found in me,
    Farre better, than I can beleeve they be.
    Much lesse, affect I =that=, which each man knowes,
    To be no more, but Counterfeits of those,
    Wherein, the =Painters=, or the =Gravers= toole,
    Befriends alike, the =Wiseman=, and the =Foole=:
    And, (when they please) can give him, by their =Art=,
    The =fairest-Face=, that had the =falsest-Heart=.
      A PICTVRE, though with most exactnesse made,
    Is nothing, but the =Shadow= of a SHADE.
    For, ev’n our =living Bodies=, (though they seeme
    To others more, or more in our esteeme)
    Are but the =shadowes= of that =Reall-being=,
    Which doth extend beyond the =Fleshly-seeing=;
    And, cannot be discerned, till we rise
    =Immortall-Objects=, for =Immortall-eyes=.
      Our =Everlasting-Substance= lies unseene,
    Behinde the Fouldings, of a =Carnall-Screene=,
    Which is, but, =Vapours= thickned into =Blood=,
    (By due concoction of our daily food)
    And, still supplied, out of other =Creatures=,
    To keepe us =living=, by their wasted natures:
    Renewing, and decaying, ev’ry Day,
    Vntill that =Vaile= must be remov’d away.
    For, this lov’d =Flesh=, wherewith, yet cloth’d we go,
    Is not the same, wee had sev’n yeares ago;
    But, rather, something which is taken-in,
    To serve insteed of what hath wasted bin,
    In =Wounds=, in =Sicknesses=, in =Colds=, and =Heates=,
    In all =Excrescions=, and in =Fumes=, and =Sweates=.
    Nor shall, this present =Flesh=, long stay with us:
    And, wee may well be pleas’d, it should be =Thus=.
      For, as I view, those Townes, and Fields, that be
    In Landskip drawne; Even so, me thinks, I see
    A Glimpes, farre off, (through FAITH’S =Prospective glasse=)
    Of that, which after =Death=, will come to passe;
    And, likewise, gained have, such meanes of seeing,
    Some things, which were, before my =Life= had being,
    That, in my =Soule=, I should be discontent,
    If, this my =Body= were, more permanent;
    Since, =Wee=, and all =God’s= other =Creatures=, here,
    Are but the =Pictures=, of what shall appeare.
      Yet, whilst they =are=, I thankfully would make
    That use of them, for their CREATOR’S sake,
    To which hee made them; and, preserve the =Table=,
    Still, =Faire= and =Full=, as much as I were able,
    By finishing, (in my alotted place)
    Those =Workes=, for which, hee fits me by his Grace.
    And, if a =Wrenne=, a =Wrenn’s= just height shall soare,
    No =Ægle=, for an =Ægle=, can doe more.
      If therefore, of my =Labours=, or of MEE,
    Ought shall remaine, when I remov’d, must be,
    Let it be that, wherein it may be view’d,
    My MAKERS =Image=, was in me renew’d:
    And, so declare, a dutifull intent,
    To doe the =Worke= I came for, e’re I went;
    That, I to others, may some =Patterne= be,
    Of =Doing-well=, as other men to mee,
    Have beene, whilst I had life: And, let my daies
    Be summed up, to my =Redeemer’s= praise.
      So this be gained, I regard it not,
      Though, all that I am else, be quite forgot._

    How Fond are they, who spend their pretious Time
    In still pursuing their deceiving _Pleasures_?
    And they, that unto ayery _Titles_ clime
    Or tyre themselves in hoording up of _Treasures_?
    For, these are _Death’s_, who, when with wearinesse
    They have acquired most, sweepes all away;
    And leaves them, for their Labors, to possesse
    Nought but a raw-bon’d _Carcasse_ lapt in clay.
    Of twenty hundred thousands, who, this houre
    Vaunt much, of those _Possessions_ they have got;
    Of their new purchac’d _Honours_, or, the _Power_,
    By which, they seeme to have advanc’t their _Lott_:
    Of this great _Multitude_, there shall not _Three_
    Remaine, for any _Future-age_ to know;
    But perish quite, and quite forgotten bee,
    As _Beasts_, devoured twice ten yeares agoe.
      Thou, therefore, who desir’st for aye to live,
    And to possesse thy _Labors_ maugre _Death_,
    To needfull _Arts_ and honest _Actions_, give
    Thy Spanne of _Time_, and thy short blast of _Breath_.
    In holy _Studies_, exercise thy _Mind_;
    In workes of _Charity_, thy _Hands_ imploy;
    That _Knowledge_, and that _Treasure_, seeke to find,
    Which may enrich thy _Heart_ with perfect _Ioy_.
    So, though obscured thou appeare, awhile,
    Despised, poore, or borne to Fortunes low,
    Thy _Vertue_ shall acquire a nobler stile,
    Then greatest _Kings_ are able to bestow:
      And, gaine thee those _Possessions_, which, nor _They_,
      Nor _Time_, nor _Death_, have power to take away.


    _The Man that hath true =Wisdome= got,

[Illustration: SAPIENTIA CONSTANS

ILLVSTR. II. _Book. 1._]

    Still fixt, and with triumphant _Laurell_ crown’d,
    Is truest _Wisdome_; whom, expressed thus,
    Among the old _Impresa’s_, we have found;
    And, much, this _Emblem_ hath instructed us.
    For, hence we learne; that, _Wisdome_ doth not flow
    From those unconstant men, whom ev’ry _Blast_,
    Or small _Occasion_, turneth to and fro;
    But, from a _Settled head_ that standeth _fast_.
    Who’ever shoulders, him, he gives no place;
    What _Storme_ soe’re, his _Times_ or _Fortunes_, breath,
    He neither hides his _Brow_, nor turnes his _Face_;
    But, keepes his Lookes undaunted, ev’n in _Death_.
    The _Laureat head_, upon the _Pillar_ set,
    Thus signifies; And that _Bay-wreath_ doth show
    That constant _Wisdome_ will the conquest get,
    When giddy _Policie_ prevailes not so.
      If, therefore, thou desirest to be taught,
    Propose good _Ends_ with honest _Meanes_ thereto,
    And therein _Constant_ be, till thou hast brought
    To perfect _end_, that _Worke_, thou hast to doe.
    Let neither flatt’ring _Pleasures_, nor _Disgrace_,
    Nor scoffing _Censures_, nor the cunning _Sleights_
    Of glozing _Sycophants_, divert that _Race_
    To which, a harmelesse _Prudence_, thee invites.
    Though others plot, conspire, and undermine,
    Keepe thou a plaine right _Path_; and let their _Course_,
    For no advantage, make thee change from _thine_,
    Although it (for the present) seemes the worse.
      He, thus that workes, puts _Policie_ to Schoole,
      And makes the _Machavilian_ prove a foole.


    _The =Law= is given to =direct=;

[Illustration: LEX REGIT ET ARMA TVENTVR.

ILLVSTR. III. _Book. 1._]

    When _God-Almighty_ first engrav’d in stone
    His holy _Law_; He did not give the same
    As if some common Act had then beene done;
    For, arm’d with _Fires_ and _Thunders_, forth it came.
    By which, that great _Law-maker_, might inferre
    What dreadfull _Vengeance_ would on those attend,
    Who did against those holy _Precepts_ erre;
    And, that, his _Power_, well-doers could defend.
    Thereto, this _Emblem_, also doth agree;
      For, loe, before the _Tables_ of the _Lawe_,
    A naked _Sword_ is borne, whose use may bee
    As well to keepe in _Safety_, as in _Awe_.
    Whence, _Princes_ (if they please) this note may take,
    (And it shall make them happily to raigne)
    That, many good and wholsome _Lawes_ to make
    Without an _Executioner_, is vaine.
      It likewise intimates, that such as are
    In _Soveraigne place_, as well obliged be
    Their zeale for true _Religion_ to declare,
    As, what concerneth _Manners_, to foresee.
    It, lastly, showes that _Princes_ should affect
    Not onely, over others to _Command_,
    But _Swords_ to weare, their _Subjects_ to protect;
    And, for their _Guard_, extend a willing hand.
    For, _Lawes_, or _Peace_ to boast of; and, the whiles,
    The _Publique-weale_, to weaken or disarme,
    Is nor the way to hinder _Civill-Broyles_,
    Nor to secure it from a _Forraigne-harme_.
      For, As by _Lawes_ a Land is kept in frame;
      So, _Armes_ is that, which must protect the same.


    _=Occasions-past= are sought in vaine;
    But, oft, they =wheele-about= again._

    Unwise are they that spend their youthfull _Prime_
    In Vanities; as if they did suppose
    That men, at pleasure, might redeeme the _Time_;
    For, they a faire advantage fondly lose.
    As ill-advis’d be those, who having lost
    The first _Occasions_, to _Despairing_ runne:
    For, _Time_ hath _Revolutions_; and, the most,
    For their Affaires, have _Seasons_ more, then one.
    Nor is their Folly small, who much depend
    On _Transitorie things_, as if their Powre
    Could bring to passe what should not have an _End_;
    Or compasse that, which _Time_ will not devoure.
      The first _Occasions_, therefore, see thou take
    (Which offred are) to bring thy hopes about;
    And, minde thou, still, what _Haste_ away they make,
    Before thy swift-pac’t houres are quite runne out.
    Yet, if an _Opportunity_ be past,
    Despaire not thou, as they that hopelesse be;
    Since, _Time_ may so revolve againe, at last,
    That _New-Occasions_ may be offred thee.
    And see, thou trust not on those fading things,
    Which by thine owne _Endeavours_ thou acquir’st:
    For, _Time_ (which her owne _Births_ to ruine brings)
    Will spare, not _thee_, nor ought which thou desir’st.
    His _Properties_, and _Vses_, what they are,
    In-vaine observ’d will be, when he is fled:
    That, they in season, therefore, may appeare,
    Our _Emblem_, thus, hath him deciphered;

      A _Razor_ in his Hand, a _Winged-Heele_.

    Svppose you _Sirs_, those mimicke _Apes_ you meet
    In strange fantasticke habits? or the Rabble,
    That in gay clothes embroyder out the street,
    Are truely of _Worshipfull_ or _Honorable_?
    Or can you thinke, that, To be borne the Sonne
    Of some rich _Alderman_, or ancient _Peere_,
    Or that the _Fame_ our Predecessors wonne
    May claime those _Wreathes_ which true _Deserving_ weare?
    Is _Honour_ due to those, who spend their dayes
    In courting one another? or consuming
    Their Fortunes and themselves, on Drabbs and Playes?
    In sleeping, drinking, and Tobacco-fuming?
    Not so. For, (though such _Fooles_, like children, place
    Gay _Titles_ on each other) _Wise-men_ know
    What slaves they be; how miserably-base;
    And, where such _Attributes_ would better show.
      An idle _Body_ clothes a vitious _Minde_;
    And, what (at best) is purchac’d by the same,
    Is nothing else, but stinking _Smoke_ and _Winde_;
    Or frothie _Bubbles_ of an empty _Fame_.
    True _Glory_, none did ever purchase, yet,
    Till, to be _Vertuous_ they could first attaine;
    Nor shall those men faire _Vertues_ favour get,
    Who _labour_ not, such _Dignities_ to gaine.
    And, this _Impresa_ doth inferre no lesse:
    For, by the _Spade_, is _Labour_ here implide;
    The _Snake_, a vertuous _Prudence_, doth expresse;
    And, _Glorie_, by the _Wreath_ is Typifide.
      For, where a vertuous _Industry_ is found,
      She, shall with Wreaths of _Glory_, thus be crown’d.

    Unhappy men are they, whose Ignorance
    So slaves them to the _Fortunes_ of the Time,
    That they (attending on the Lot of _Chance_)
    Neglect by _Vertue_, and _Deserts_, to clime.
    Poore _Heights_ they be which _Fortune_ reares unto;
    And, fickle is the _Favour_ she bestowes:
    To-day, she makes; to-morrow, doth undoe;
    Builds up, and in an instant overthrowes.
    On easie _Wheeles_, to Wealth, and Honours high,
    She windes men oft, before they be aware;
    And, when they dreame of most _Prosperitie_,
    Downe, headlong, throwes them lower then they were.
      You, then, that seeke a more assur’d estate,
    On good, and honest _Objects_, fixe your _Minde_,
    And follow _Vertue_, that you may a _Fate_
    Exempt from feare of Change, or Dangers, finde.
    For, he that’s _Vertuous_, whether high or low
    His _Fortune_ seemes (or whether foule or faire
    His _Path_ he findes) or whether friend, or foe,
    The _World_ doth prove; regards it not a haire.
    His _Losse_ is _Gaine_; his _Poverty_ is _Wealth_;
    The Worlds _Contempt_, he makes his _Diadem_;
    In _Sicknesse_, he rejoyceth, as in _Health_:
    Yea, _Death_ it selfe, becommeth _Life_, to him.
    He feares no disrespect, no bitter scorne,
    Nor subtile plottings, nor Oppressions force;
    Nay, though the World should topsie-turvie turne,
    It cannot fright him, nor divert his Course.
      Above all Earthly powres his _Vertue_ reares him;
      And, up with _Eglets_ wings, to Heav’n it beares him.

    Why, silly Man! so much admirest thou
    Thy present _Fortune_? overvaluing so
    Thy _Person_, or the beauty of thy _Brow_?
    And _Cloth’d_, so proudly, wherefore dost thou goe?
    Why dost thou live in riotous _Excesse_?
    And _Boast_, as if thy Flesh immortall were?
    Why dost thou gather so? Why so oppresse?
    And, o’re thy Fellow-creatures, _Domineere_?
    Behold this _Emblem_; such a thing was hee
    Whom this doth represent as now thou art;
    And, such a Fleshlesse _Raw-bone_ shalt thou bee,
    Though, yet, thou seeme to act a comelier part.
    Observe it well; and marke what _Vglinesse_
    Stares through the sightlesse _Eye-holes_, from within:
    Note those leane _Craggs_, and with what _Gastlinesse_,
    That horrid _Countenance_ doth seeme to grin.
    Yea, view it well; and having seene the same
    Plucke downe that _Pride_ which puffs thy heart so high;
    Of thy _Proportion_ boast not, and (for shame)
    Repent thee of thy sinfull _Vanity_.
    And, having learn’d, that, all men must become
    Such bare _Anatomies_; and, how this _Fate_
    No mortall _Powre_, nor _Wit_, can keepe thee from;
    Live so, that _Death_ may better thy estate.
    Consider who created thee; and why:
    Renew thy _Spirit_, ere thy _Flesh_ decayes:
    More _Pious_ grow; Affect more _Honestie_;
    And seeke hereafter thy _Creatours_ praise.

    False _Hearts_ beneath _Faire-spoken Words_ to hyde:
    For, they o’revaile themselves but with a _Sive_,
    Through which, their purposes at length are spyde.
    And, then, they either woefully-lament
    Their _Brutish-folly_, or so hardned grow
    In Sinning, that they never can repent,
    Nay, jest and scoffe at their owne Overthrow.
      But no false _Vaile_ can serve (when _God_ will smite)
      To save a _Scorner_, or an _Hypocrite_.

    I Will not blame those grieved Hearts that shed
    _Becoming-teares_, for their departed Friends;
    Nor those who sigh out _Passions_ for the _Dead_;
    Since, on _Good-natures_, this Disease attends.
    When _Sorrow_ is conceiv’d, it must have Vent
    (In Sighes or Moysture) or the Heart will breake;
    And, much they aggravate our Discontent,
    Who, out of _Season_, _Reason_ seeme to speake.
    Yet, since our Frailty may require we should
    _Remembrances_ admit to keepe us from
    Excesse in _Griefe_: this _Emblem_ here behold,
    And take such _Hope_ as may our _Teares_ become.
      The _Wheat_ although a while it lyes in Earth,
    (And seemeth lost) consumes not quite away;
    But, from that _Wombe_ receives another _Birth_,
    And, with _Additions_, riseth from the Clay.
    Much more shall _Man_ revive, whose worth is more:
    For, _Death_, who from our Drosse will us refine,
    Vnto that other _Life_, becomes the _Doore_,
    Where, we in _Immortalitie_ shall shine.
    When once our _Glasse_ is runne, we presently
    Give up our _Soules_ to _Death_; So _Death_ must give
    Our _Bodies_ backe againe, that we, thereby,
    The _Light_ of _Life eternall_, may receive.
    The Venom’d _Sting_ of _Death_ is tooke away;
    And, now, the _Grave_, that was a Place of _Feare_,
    Is made a _Bed of Rest_, wherein we may
    Lye downe in _Hope_, and bide in safety, there.
      When we are _Borne_, to _Death_-ward straight we runne;
      And by our _Death_, our _Life_ is new-begnnne.

    My hopefull _Friends_ at thrice five yeares and three,
    Without a _Guide_ (into the World alone)
    To seeke my _Fortune_, did adventure mee;
    And, many hazards, I alighted on.
    First, _Englands_ greatest _Rendevouz_ I sought,
    Where VICE and VERTVE at the highest sit;
    And, thither, both a _Minde_ and _Bodie_ brought,
    For neither of their Services unfit.
    Both, woo’d my _Youth_: And, both perswaded so,
    That (like the _Young man_ in our _Emblem_ here)
    I stood, and cry’d, _Ah! which way shall I goe?_
    To me so pleasing both their Offers were.
    VICE, _Pleasures_ best Contentments promist mee,
    And what the wanton _Flesh_ desires to have:
    Quoth VERTVE, _I will Wisdome give to thee,
    And those brave things, which noblest Mindes doe crave_.
    _Serve me_ said VICE, _and thou shalt soone acquire
    All those Atchievements which my Service brings_:
    _Serve me_ said VERTVE, _and Ile raise thee higher,
    Then VICES can, and teach thee better things_.
    Whil’st thus they strove to gaine me, I espyde
    Grim _Death_ attending VICE; and, that her Face
    Was but a painted _Vizard_, which did hide
    The foul’st Deformity that ever was.
    _LORD, grant me grace for evermore to view
    Her Vglinesse: And, that I viewing it,
    Her Falsehoods and allurements may eschew;
    And on faire VERTVE my Affection set;
      Her Beauties contemplate, her Love embrace,
      And by her safe Direction, runne my Race._

    Among their stinging-Swarms thrusts in his pawes;
    Adventureth to climbe up hollow Trees,
    And from their _Cells_, the well fill’d _Combes_ he drawes:
    Right so, the _Sensuall-Man_ that he may gaine
    His bruitish _Lust_, a thousand perills dares;
    And, that his _Lawlesse-will_ he may attaine,
    Nor _Conscience_, _Credit_, _Cost_, nor _Labour_ spares.

    With many _Thornes_, and such a Prickling-guard,

    The winged Arrow surely hits the same.
    Her _Picture_, therefore, in this place doth shew
    The Nature of their _Mindes_ who _Cynthia_-like,
    With _Constancie_ their _Purposes_ pursue,
    And faint not till they compasse what they seeke.
    For, nought more _God-like_ in this World is found,
    Then so _Resolv’d a man_, that nothing may
    His _Resolution_ alter or confound,
    When any taske of _Worth_, he doth assay.
    Nor, is there greater Basenesse, then those _Mindes_
    That from an _Honest-purpose_, can be wrought

    But, never by a _Motion-indirect_;
    Nor, will they stop the Course that they are in,
    Vntill they bring their purpose to effect.

    How many _Arrowes_ from his Bowe are gone,
    As we observe how nigh the _Marke_ he shot:
    And, justly we deride that Man who spends
    His _Time_ and _Shafts_, but never ayme doth take
    To hit the _White_; or foolishly pretends,
    The number of the Shots, doth _Archers_ make.
    So, _God_, who marketh our Endeavours, here,
    Doth not by _tale_, account of them receive;
    But, heedeth rather how _well meant_ they were,
    And, at his _Will_ how rightly aym’d we have.
      It is not mumbling over thrice a day
    A Set of _Ave Maries_, or of _Creeds_,

    Nor is it, up and downe the Land to seeke
    To finde those well breath’d _Lecturers_, that can
    Preach thrice a _Sabbath_, and sixe times a weeke,
    Yet be as fresh, as when they first beganne:
    Nor, is it, such like things perform’d by _Number_
    Which _God_ respects: Nor doth his _Wisdome_ crave
    Those many _Vanities_, wherewith some cumber
    Their _Bodies_, as if those their _Soules_ could save.
    For, not _Much-doing_, but _Well-doing_, that
    Which _God_ commands, the _Doer_, justifies.
    To pray without _Devotion_, is to _Prate_;
    And, _Hearing_ is but halfe our _Exercise_.
      We ought not, therefore, to regard, alone,
      How _often_, but how _Well_, the _Worke_ be done.

    We found but little, for our Vse prepar’d,
    Save that, which by _Hard-Labour_, must be sought.
    In many _Stormes_, unheeded, we are faine
    To seeke out needfull things; and, smilingly
    To jest, at what some others would complaine:
    That, none might laugh at our _Necessity_.
    Yea, some have liv’d on _Huskes_, whil’st others fed
    On that which was their _Labours_ due Reward;
    And, were pursu’d (till they almost were dead)
    Without the Worlds Compassion or Regard.
    Yet, by _Enduring_, they out liv’d the Blast

    (Expecting calmer Seasons) at the last,

      Their _Suffring-much_, hath made their _Suffrings_ none;

    Which reall seeme; that, for a time, they may
    Appeare the _Children_ of _Vnfeigned-Hearts_:
    Yea, Many-times, true _Turtles_ are deceiv’d
    By counterfeited _Passions_, till their _Love_
    Of her true _Object_ findes her selfe bereav’d;
    And, after it, is forced to remove:
    But, where _True-Love_ begetteth, and enjoyes
    The proper _Object_, which shee doth desire,
    Nor _Time_, nor _Injury_ the same destroyes;
    But, it continues a _Perpetuall Fire_.
      Like am’rous _Thisbe_ to her _Pyramus_,
    On all occasions, it continues true:
    Nor _Night_, nor _Danger_, makes it timorous;
    But, through all Perills, it will him pursue.
      Thus, both in _Life_, in _Death_, in all estates,
      True-_Lovers_ will be true-_Associates_.

    The _Westerne-Indians_, when they want a Fire
    To warme their naked limbs, or dresse their Food,
    At ev’ry need, accomplish their Desire,
    By often rubbing of two _Stickes of Wood_.
      From whence, these _Observations_ we may take;
    First, that in them whose Natures gentlest are,
    A long _Contention_ such a Change may make,
    As did, before, scarce possible appeare.
      Next, that when _Two_ in _Opposition_ bee,
    Whose power and strength and Malice is the same,
    Their strugling Hearts but seldome doe agree,
    Till they beget, a _Selfe-devouring-Flame_.
      And, thirdly, it informes, that those chast _Fires_
    Which on _Loves Altars_ keepe a Lasting-Heat;
    Are those, which in two Hearts, two _Like-Desires_
    Vpon each other, mutually beget.
    Hence, therefore, learne thou, first, not to contemne
    Their _Mildnesse_, who to anger are not prone;
    Lest, many wrongs doe stirre up _Fires_ in them,
    And worke thee Mischiefe, when thou look’st for none.
      Be wary, next, though thou thy selfe be strong,
    How with a pow’rfull Foe thou dost contend;
    For, they that wrastle in _Contention_, long,
    Will, sure, beshrew their Madnesse, in the end.
      And, if to warme thee by _Loves_ Fires thou seeke,
    Thy _Peere_ in _Yeares_, and _Manners_, pray to finde;
    Let both your _Aymes_, and _Longings_, be alike;
    Be one in _Faith_, and _Will_; and, one in _Minde_:
      So, you shall reape the fruits of your Desire,
      And warme each other with a kindly _Fire_.

    Their Custome was to ratifie it, thus;
    Before their _Idoll-God_, they slew a _Sow_,
    And sayd aloud; _So be it unto us_.
    Implying, that, if otherwise they did
    Then had been vow’d; or, if within their Brest
    A _Fraudulent-Intention_ had beene hid,
    They merited such Vsage, as that _Beast_.
    For, by the _Swine_ that they had slaughtred so,
    (Which, during Life, was helpefull unto none)
    Of Life deprived by a sudden blow,
    And, then, cast out, that none might feed thereon;
    They, mystically did inferre; that, he
    Who falsify’d that _Oath_ which he had sworne,
    Deserv’d, by _Sudden-Death_, cut off to be;
    And, as a Beast uncleane, to lye forlorne.

    This _Christian-Doctrine_; that, we should in _Vowes_,

    A Troubled _Minde_, ore-charged with _Desires_,
    Betweene great _Hopes_, and no lesse _Feares_ opprest,
    And payned inwardly with secret _Fires_,
    Was thus, by some, in former times exprest.
    A _Smoking Heart_, they placed just betwixt
    A _Fastned Anchor_, and a _Bended Bow_;
    To which a _Barbed-Arrow_ seemed fixt,
    And, ready from the _Strayned-String_ to goe.
    The _Smoke_ doth _Sighes_, the _Anchor_ doth declare
    That _Hope_, which keepes us from Despairing quite;
    The _Bowe_ and _Arrow_, signifie that _Feare_,
    Which doth, perpetually, the Soule affright.
      And, by this _Emblem_, it appeares to me
    That they which are with strong _Desires_ opprest,
    (Though good or bad the Object of them be)
    In seeking _Pleasures_, finde no small unrest:
    For, they are not by _Feares_, alone, disturbed,
    But, as the _Wiseman_ saith, ev’n _Hope-Delayd
    Torments the Heart_; and, when _Desire_ is curbed,
    The Soule becommeth sad, and ill-apayd.
      A _Groundlesse-Hope_, makes entrance for _Despaire_,
    And with Deceiving-showes the Heart betrayes:
    A _Causelesse-Feare_, doth _Reasons_ force impaire,
    And, terrifies the Soule, in doubtfull wayes.
    Yet, quite neglect them not; For, _Hope_ repells
    That _Griefe_ sometimes, which would our Hearts oppresse.
    And, _Feare_ is otherwhile the _Sentinell_
    Which rouzeth us from dang’rous _Carelesnesse_.
      Thus, _Both_ are good: but, _Both_ are Plagues to such,

    Nor _Wit_, nor _Patience_, have we to conceive,
    That ev’ry thing, which may by Man be wrought,
    Proportionable _Time_, and _Meanes_, must have;
    Before it can be to _Perfection_, brought.
    Yet, ev’ry day, in things of ev’ry kinde,
    _Experience_ hath informed us, herein;
    And, that, in many things, a change we finde,
    Which, at the first, would scarce believ’d have bin.
      For, though a _Gosling_ will not prove a _Swan_,
    _Vnruely-Colts_ become _well-trayned Steeds_;
    A _Silly-Childe_ growes up a _Mighty-Man_,
    And, _Lofty-Trees_ doe Spring from _Little Seeds_.
      Learne, therefore hence, that, nothing you despise,
    Because it may, at first, imperfect seeme:
    And, know, how all things (in some sort) to prise,
    Although, you give them not the best esteeme.
      From hence, moreover, learne; not to despaire,
    When you have just occasion, to pursue
    A toylesome worke, or any great affaire:
    Since, _all-things_, at the first, from nothing, grew.
    And, I my selfe will, also, learne, from hence,
    (Of all my Paines, though little fruits I see)
    Nor to repine, nor to receive Offence;
    But, rather joy in what befalleth mee.
      For, though my _Hopes_ appeare but meanely growne,
      They will be _Great_, when some shall thinke them none.


    _When we above the =Crosse= can rise,
    A =Crowne=, for us, prepared lies._

[Illustration: SVPERATA CRVCE CORONOR

ILLVSTR. XLVII. _Book. 1._]

    A _Serpent_ rais’d above the Letter _Tau_,
    Aspiring to a _Crowne_, is figur’d here:
    From whence, a _Christian-Morall_ we may draw,
    Which worth our good regarding will appeare.
    For, by those _Characters_, in briefe, I see
    Which _Way_, we must to Happinesse ascend;
    Then, by what _Meanes_, that Path must clymed bee;
    And, what _Reward_, shall thereupon attend.
      The _Crosse_, doth shew, that _Suffring_ is the _Way_;
    The _Serpent_, seemes to teach me, that, if I
    Will overcome, I must not then, assay
    To _force_ it; but, my selfe thereto _applye_.
    For, by embracing what we shall not shunne,
    We winde about the _Crosse_, till wee arise
    Above the same; and, then, what _Prize_ is wonne,
    The _Crowne_, which overtops it, signifies.
      Let me, O _God_, obtaine from thee the Grace,
    To be partaker of thy Blessed _Passion_;
    Let me, with Willingnesse, thy _Crosse_ imbrace,
    And, share the Comforts of thy _Exaltation_.
    To beare that Part, whereto I doomed am,
    My Heart, with Strength, and Courage, _Lord_, inspire:
    Then, _Crucifie_ my _Flesh_ upon the same,
    As much as my _Corruption_ shall require.
    And, when by thy Assistance, I am rear’d
    Above that _Burthen_, which lyes yet upon me;
    And, over all, which (justly may be fear’d)
    Shall, during Life-time, be inflicted on me;
      Among those _Blessed-Soules_, let me be found,
      Which, with eternall _Glory_, shall be _Crown’d_.


    _In =Death=, no =Difference= is made,

ILLVSTR. XLVIII. _Book. 1._]

    Let no man be so sottish as to dreame,
    Though all Men in their _Death_ made equall are,
    That, therfore, they may gather by this _Theame_,
    That, _Parity_, in Life-time, fitting were.
    For, as the _Bodies_ Members (which in _Death_
    Have all the like esteeme) had their Degrees,
    And Honours, differing in time of _breath_;
    The same (in _States_) Discretion comely sees.
      Nor, should we hence inferre, that it were just
    To disesteeme the breathlesse _Carcasses_
    Of _Kings_ and _Princes_, when they sleepe in Dust;
    For, _Civill-Reverence_ is due to these.
    Nor, ought we, in their Life-time, to apply
    The Truth, which by this _Emblem_ is declar’d,
    The _Dignities_ of Men to vilifie;
    Or, bring upon their _Persons_ lesse regard.
      That, which from hence, I rather wish to preach,
    Is this; that ev’ry Man of each degree,
    Would marke it so, that he, himselfe might teach
    What thoughts and deeds, to him most proper be.
    If he be great; let him remember, then,
    That (since, nor _Wealth_, nor _Title_, can procure him
    Exemption from the Doomes of other Men)
    He ought to seeke, how _Vertue_ may secure him.
    If he be _Poore_; let him this _Comfort_ take,
    That, though, awhile, he be afflicted here,
    Yet, _Death_ may him as fully happy make,
    As he, that doth a _Crowne Imperiall_ weare.
      For, when his Fatall-blow, _Death_ comes to strike,
      He, makes the _Beggar_, and the _King_, alike.

ILLVSTR. XLIX. _Book. 1._]

    Some Foolish-_Boyes_ (and such a _Boy_ was I)
    When they at Schoole have certaine houres to passe,
    (To which they are compell’d unwillingly)
    Much time they spend in shaking of the _Glasse_:
    Thus, what they practise, to make-short their stay,
    Prolongs it more; for while they seeke to force
    The _Sands_, to runne more speedily away,
    They interrupt them; and, they passe the worse.
      Right so, in other things, with us it fares;
    (And, seeming wise, we act a foolish part)
    For, otherwhile, what _Time_ alone prepares,
    We seeke to make the subject of an _Art_.
    Sometimes, by _Rashnesse_, we endeavour what
    We ought with _Leisure_, and _Advice_, to doe:
    But, if a good _Successe_ doth follow, that,
    Our _Wit_ was nothing helpefull thereunto.
    Sometime, againe, we prosecute a thing
    By _Violence_; when our desir’d effect,
    No other meanes so well to passe can bring,
    As _Love_ and _Gentlenesse_, which we neglect.
      But, let this _Emblem_ teach us to regard
    What _Way of Working_, to each _Worke_ pertaines:
    So, though some Portion of our Hopes be barr’d,
    We shall not, altogether, lose our paines.
    Some things are _strong_, and, othersome are _weake_;
    With _Labour_, some; and, some with _Ease_ be wrought:
    Although the _Reed_ will bend, the _Kexe_ will breake;
    And, what _mends_ one thing, makes another _naught_.
      Marke this; And, when much _Haste_ will marre thy _Speed_,
      That, then, thou take good _Leisure_; take thou _Heed_.


    _Of =Little-Gaines=, let Care be had;
    For, of small =Eares=, great =Mowes= are made._

[Illustration: DE PARVIS GRANDIS ACERVVS ERIT.

ILLVSTR. L. _Book. 1._]

    Among the many Faylings of the _Time_,
    This _Emblem_ giveth Cause to mention one,
    Which, unto me, doth seeme the greater _Crime_,
    Because, to many, it appeareth none.
      I finde, that petty things are so neglected
    (Well nigh of all) in _Losings_ and in _Winnings_,
    As if, what ere they thought to have effected,
    Subsisted without _Members_, or _Beginnings_.
    The Man, that loseth every _Month_ a _Penny_,
    May salve-up _Twelve-months_ Losses, with a _Shilling_.
    But, if of other Losses he hath many,
    To save a _Pin_, at length, he shall be willing.
    For, he that sees his Wine-fill’d _Vessell_ drop,
    (Although a _Drop_, in value, be but small)
    Should, thence, Occasion take, the _Leake_ to stop,
    Lest many _Droppings_ draine him drye of all.
    Moreover, they, that will to _Greatnesse_ rise,
    A Course, not much unlike to this, must keepe:
    They ought not _Small-Beginnings_ to despise;
    Nor, strive to _runne_, before they learne to _creepe_.
    By many single _Eares_, together brought,
    The _Hand_ is fill’d; by _Handfulls_, we may gaine
    A _Sheafe_; with many _Sheaves_ a Barne is fraught:
    Thus, oft, by _Little_, we doe much obtaine.
      Consider this; And, though I wish not thee
    To take, of _Trifling-things_, too great a care;
    Yet, know thus much (for truth) it best will bee,
    If all things may be weighed as they are:
      By _slender_ Losses, _great_-ones are begunne;
      By many trifling _Gaines_, much _Wealth_ is wonne.

THE FIRST LOTTERIE.


1

    Thou, dost overmuch respect
    That, which will thy harme effect;
    But, some other things there bee,
    Which will more advantage thee:
    Search thy heart; and, thou shalt, there,
    Soone discover, what they are:
    Yea, thine _Emblem_ showes thee, too,
    What to shunne; and, what to doe.

See, _Emblem_ I.


2

    It is a little fear’d, that you
    Are to your owne Designes, untrue;
    And, that, if you more constant were,
    You would be richer, then you are,
    (It may be, also, wiser, too)
    Looke, therefore, what you are to doe:
    Then, follow it, and, you will say,
    That, well advis’d, you were, to day.

See, _Emb._ II.


3

    How rich or poore soe’re thou be,
    Thou, art a _Prince_, in some degree;
    And, o’re thy selfe, thou shouldst command,
    As doth a _Monarch_, in his Land.
    Within thy Heart, therefore, ingrave
    The Lawes, that _Grace_ and _Nature_ gave:
    For, thus (to counsell thee) inclines
    That _Emblem_, which, thy _Lot_ assignes.

See, _Emb._ III.


4

    Much Liberty, thou hast assum’d;
    And, heretofore, so much presum’d
    On _Time_, which, alway rideth poast,
    That, for awhile, some _Hopes_ are crost.
    But, loe, to keepe thee from _Despaire_,
    And, thy _Misfortune_, to repaire,
    Marke, what to thee, by _Lot_, befell,
    And, practise, what is counsell’d, well.

See, _Emb._ IV.


5

    Thou seekest _Honour_, to obtaine,
    By meanes, which frustrate all thy paine.
    Thy Predecessors rich were made,
    By using of the _Plough_ and _Spade_:
    Thou, honourable wouldst be thought,
    By taking Courses, that are naught;
    But, if, right noble, thou wilt be,
    Looke, what thine _Emblem_ counsells thee.

See, _Emb._ V.


_M_ 6

    This Man, what ever he may seeme,
    Is worthy of a high esteeme:
    Though _Fortune_ may, his person, grinde;
    She, cannot harme him, in his _Minde_.
    Right blest, this _Company_ would be,
    If all of them, were such, as _He_.
    Reade that _Impresa_, which he drew;
    For, that, in part, the same will shew.

See, _Emb._ VI.


_M_ 7

    If some, now present, this had got,
    They, would have blushed, at their _Lot_;
    Since, very fit, the same doth prove
    For one, that’s either light of _Love_,
    Or, troubled with a fickle _Mate_:
    If you enjoy a better _Fate_,
    Yet, hearken, what your _Lot_ doth say;
    Lest, you, hereafter, need it may,

See, _Emb._ VII.


8

    For ought, that, plainely, doth appeare,
    You may out-live the longest, here;
    Yet, seeing, now, of all this crew,
    The _Lot_ of _Death_, you, onely, drew,
    See what, your _Emblem_ hath injoyn’d;
    And, still, that Morall, beare in minde:
    So, _Deaths_ deform’d and ghastly _Shade_
    Shall, _Meanes_ of _Life_, to thee, be made.

See, _Emb._ VIII.


9

    Though you have _Wit_, and, know it well;
    That, rash you are, your _Friends_ can tell;
    Yea, _Sleepe_, and _Ease_, possesse you so,
    That, some doe feare, you’l sottish grow:
    But, lo, your hind’rance, to prevent,
    This _Lot_, was, peradventure, sent;
    For, in the _Moralls_, that, insue,
    Are _Counsells_, fit, for such as you.

See, _Emb._ IX.


10

    You, have beene wronged, many wayes,
    Yet, _patient_ are; and, that’s your praise:
    Your _Actions_, also, seem’d upright;
    Yet, some there are, that, beare you spite:
    Lest, therefore, you discourag’d grow,
    An _Emblem_, you have drawne, to show
    What other _Innocents_ have borne,
    And, how, the worlds despites, to scorne.

See, _Emb._ X.


_M_ 11

    Doubtlesse, you are either wooing,
    Or, some other _Bus’nesse_, doing;
    Which, you shall attempt, in vaine,
    Or, much hazzard all your paine:
    Yet, if good, your _meanings_ are,
    Doe not honest _meanes_ forbeare;
    For, where things are, well, begunne,
    _God_, oft, workes, when Man hath done.

See, _Emb._ XI.


12

    Be not angry, if I tell
    That, you love the _World_, too well;
    For, this _Lot_, perhaps, you drew,
    That, such _Faults_, you might eschew.
    Marke, to what their Soules aspire,
    Who, true _Blessednesse_, desire:
    For, if you can doe, like those,
    _Heav’n_ you gaine, when _Earth_ you lose.

See, _Emb._ XII.


13

    You love the _Rich_; and, honour them;
    The needy-person, you contemne:
    Yet, _Wealth_, nor want of _Wealth_, is that,
    Which, _wretched_ makes, or _fortunate_:
    From other _Causes_, those things flow;
    Which, since, you either doe not know,
    Or, heede not much, this _Emblem_ came,
    That, you might learne to minde the same.

See, _Emb._ XIII.


_M_ 14

    Thy _Chance_ is doubtfull; and, as yet,
    I know not, what to say of it;
    But, this I know, a foe thou art
    To what thine _Emblem_ hath, in part,
    Expressed by a _Mimicke Shape_;
    Or, thou, thy selfe, art such an _Ape_.
    Now, which of these, pertaines to thee,
    Let them, that know thee, Iudges bee.

See, _Emb._ XIV.


15

    Thy Vertues he may wrong, that sayes
    Thou spend’st thy selfe, in wanton wayes;
    But, some have thought, and sayd of late,
    That, those thou lov’st, consume thy state:
    Yet, spare nor _Time_, nor Substance, tho,
    Where, them, thou oughtest to bestow;
    But, to thine _Emblem_ turne, and, see
    When Life, and Wealth, well ventur’d bee.

See, _Emb._ XV.


16

    Though _Troubles_, you may have (or had)
    Enough, to make some others mad;
    Yet, be content: for, they, that are
    As weake, have had as much to beare;
    And, that, which _Malice_ did contrive,
    To make them poore, hath made them thrive.
    That _Emblem_, which, by _Lot_, you drew,
    Prognosticates, as much, for you.

See, _Emb._ XVI.


17

    Though, you suffer blame and paine,
    You, at last, may Comfort gaine,
    (Sharing _Honours_, truely gotten,
    When, your Foes are dead, and rotten)
    For, of this, you have a pawne,
    In the _Lot_, that you have drawne;
    And, by that, it may appeare,
    What your paines, and wages, are.

See, _Emb._ XVII.


18

    Take you serious heed, I pray,
    Whither, you doe goe to day;
    Whom you credite; and, for whom
    You, ingaged, shall become;
    And, unlesse you wish for Sorrow,
    Be as provident, to morrow:
    For, there are some traps and Snares,
    Which, may take you unawares.

See, _Emb._ XVIII.


19

    Your _Wit_, so much, you trust upon,
    That, weaker _Meanes_ hath yours out-gone;
    Sometime, you runne, when there is need
    Of much more _Warinesse_, then _Speed_.
    But, you, to _God_-ward, worse have err’d;
    And, yet, _Amendment_ is deferr’d.
    See, therefore, what your _Chance_ doth say,
    And, take good _Counsell_, while you may.

See, _Emb._ XIX.


20

    Take heed, you doe not quite forget,
    That you are dauncing in a _Net_:
    More, then a few, your Course doe see,
    Though, you, suppose, unseene to be.
    Your Fault, we will no nearer touch;
    Me-thinkes your _Emblem_ blabs too much:
    But, if, you minde, what is amisse,
    You, shall be nere the worse, for this.

See, _Emb._ XX.


21

    Let such, as draw this _Lot_, have care,
    For _Death_, and _Sorrow_, to prepare
    All times, to come, lest one of these,
    Their persons, unexpected, seize:
    For, them, or some of theirs, to stay,
    Pale _Death_, drawes neerer, ev’ry day.
    Yet, let them not, disheartned, bee:
    For, in their _Emblem_, they shall see,
    _Death_, may (though, in appearance, grim)
    Become, a _blessing_, unto them.

See, _Emb._ XXI.


22

    With _Mary_, thou art one of those,
    By whom, the better part, is chose;
    And, though, thou tempted art, astray,
    Continu’st in a lawfull way.
    Give _God_ the praise, with heart unfaign’d,
    That, he, such _Grace_ to thee, hath dain’d;
    And, view thy _Lot_, where thou shalt see,
    What _Hag_, hath layd a _Trap_, for thee.

See, _Emb._ XXII.


23

    Although, that, thou demure appeare,
    For _Pleasure_, there is no man here
    Will venture more: And, some there are,
    Who thinke you venture over farre:
    Hereof, consider well, therefore,
    E’re, so, you venture, any more;
    And, in your Lotted _Emblem_, see,
    For what, your _Suffrings_ ought to bee.

See, _Emb._ XXIII.


24

    If ought, thou purpose, to assay,
    Pursue the same, without delay;
    And, if thou meane to gather fruit,
    Be constant in thy _Hopes_ pursuit:
    For, by thine _Emblem_, thou mayst finde,
    Thy _Starres_, to thee, are well-inclin’d;
    Provided, thy _Attempts_ be good:
    For, that, is ever understood.

See, _Emb._ XXIV.


25

    Take heed, thou love not their deceipt,
    Who _Number_ give, in steed of _Weight_;
    Nor, let their Fansies, thee abuse,
    Who, such-like foolish _Customes_, use.
    Perhaps, it may concerne thee, much,
    To know the _Vanities_ of such;
    And, who they are: Marke, therfore, what
    Thine _Emblem_, will, to thee relate.

See, _Emb._ XXV.

    And, thine owne _Over-sights_ discerne,
    Thy _Lot_ (as to a Schoole to day)
    Hath sent thee to the _Squirrells_ Dray;

    By some loose wanton, ere’t be long:
    Therfore, e’re, hence, you passe away,

    Much feare, your top will spring too high;
    Nay, yet, some _Burthen_, you sustaine:

    This _Lot_, befell thee, for the nonce;
    For, if things come not, all at once,
    Thou, to despairing, soone, dost runne,
    Or, leav’st the Worke, that’s well begun:
    Which, to prevent, regardfull be

    Therefore, though this, in sport, be done,

    Now, some good _Counsell_, thou dost need;
    Of what we say, take, therefore, heed.
    Beware, lest thou, too much, offend
    A meeke, and, gentle-natur’d, _Friend_:
    Though pow’r thou hast, be carefull, too,
    Thou vexe not, long, thine able _Foe_;
    And, e’re thou love, be sure to finde
    Thy _Match_, in _Manners_, and in _Minde_.
    If thou demand a Reason, why,
    To thee, thine _Emblem_ will replie.

See, _Emb._ XXXIV.


35

    Beware, thou share not in their crime,
    Who care, but for the present time:
    For, by thy _Lot_, wee may suspect,
    Or that, or things, to that effect.
    If so it be, or if thy Minde,
    To such an _Errour_, be inclin’d,
    Thy _Chance_, unto an _Emblem_, brings,
    Which, will advise to better things.

See, _Emb._ XXXV.


36

    You, love to _seeme_; this, all Men see:
    But, would you lov’d, as well, to _bee_.
    If, also, better use were made
    Of those good _Blessings_, you have had;
    Your praise were more. Marke, therefore, well,
    What _Moralls_, now, your _Emblem_, tell;
    And, gather, from it, what you may,
    To set you in a better way.

See, _Emb._ XXXVI.


37

    To scape a Storme, great thought you take;
    But, little heed, what _meanes_ you make.
    You, love your ease, and, Troubles, feare;
    But, carelesse are, what _Course_ you steere.
    Which _Indiscretions_, to prevent,
    You, to an _Emblem_, now, are sent:
    Whereof, if you regardfull are,
    You, lesse will feare, and better fare.

See, _Emb._ XXXVII.


38

    What you have, done, consider, now;
    For, this your _Chance_, doth seeme to show
    That you have sworne, or vow’d, of late,
    Or promised (you best know what)
    Which, you have, since, unwilling bin,
    To keepe; or, else, did faile, therein.
    If it be so; repent, or els,
    What will befall, your _Emblem_ tells.

See, _Emb._ XXXVIII.


39

    Thy _Hopings_, and thy _Feares_, are such,
    That, they afflict, and paine thee, much;
    Because, thou giv’st too great a scope
    Vnto thy _Feare_, or to thy _Hope_:
    For, they will paine, or pleasure thee,
    As they enlarg’d, or curbed be.
    But, lo; thine _Emblem_, if thou please,
    Instructs thee, how, to mannage these.

See, _Emb._ XXXIX.


40

    Let them, who get this _Chance_, beware,
    Lest _Cupid_ snarle them in a Snare:
    For, by their _Lot_, they should be apt
    To be, in such-like Ginnes, intrapt.
    Some helpe, is by their _Emblem_, got,
    If they, too late, observe it not;
    But, then, no profit will be done them:
    For, _Counsell_ will be lost upon them.

See, _Emb._ XL.


41

    Whether, meerely, _Chance_, or no,
    Brought this _Lot_, we doe not know:
    But, received, let it be,
    As, divinely, sent to thee:
    For, that, merits thy regard,
    Which, thine _Emblem_ hath declar’d;
    And, the best, that are, have need,
    Such _Advisements_, well to heed.

See, _Emb._ XLI.


42

    Thou, hast already, or, e’re long,
    Shalt have some dammage by the _Tongue_:
    But, fully, yet, it is not knowne,
    Whether the _Tongue_ shall be thine owne,
    Or else, anothers _tongue_, from whom
    This Mischiefe, unto thee, shall come:
    But, much the better, thou shalt speed,
    If, now, thine _Emblem_, well thou heed.

See, _Emb._ XLII.


43

    Vnworthy things, thou dost affect,
    With somewhat overmuch respect;
    Vnto the _World_, inclining so,
    As if thy Hopes were all below:
    But, now, to rowse thee from this crime,
    Good _Counsell_ comes in happy time.
    Make use thereof; and, thinke it not
    Meere casuall, or a needlesse _Lot_.

See, _Emb._ XLIII.


44

    Thou, either, too much love, hast plac’t
    On things, that will not alway last;
    Or else, thou art a little fear’d.
    Because thy Hopes are long deferr’d:
    Nay, thou art touch’d, in both of these.
    Thy Profit, therefore, and thine ease,
    It will effect, if well thou minde
    What, in thine _Emblem_, thou shalt finde.

See, _Emb._ XLV.


45

    When thou hast _Changes_, good, or bad,
    Ore-joy’d, thou art, or over-sad;
    As if it seemed very strange
    To see the _Winde_ or _Weather_, change:
    Lo, therefore, to remember thee,
    How changeable, things Mortall, bee,
    Thou, art assisted by this _Lot_;
    Now, let it be, no more, forgot.

See, _Emb._ XLV.


46

    Of thy just _Aymes_, though meanes be slight,
    Thou mayst attaine their wished height;
    Vnlesse, thy Folly shall destroy
    The Weale, thou seekest to injoy,
    By thy Despaire, or by neglect
    Of that, which, may thy _Hopes_ effect:
    For, by thine _Emblem_, thou mayst know,
    Great things, from small _Beginnings_, grow.

See, _Emb._ XLVI.


47

    Thou must have _Crosses_; but they, shall,
    To _Blessings_, be converted, all;
    And, _Suffrings_, will become, thy Praise,
    If, _Wisedome_ order, well, thy wayes:
    Yea, when thy _Crosses_ ended are,
    A Crowne of Glory, thou shalt weare.
    Yet, note, how this to passe is brought:
    For, in thine _Emblem_, it is taught.

See, _Emb._ XLVII.


48

    If they, who drew this _Lot_, now be
    Of great _Estate_, or high _Degree_,
    They shall ere long, become as poore,
    As those, that beg from doore to doore.
    If poore they be; it plaine appeares,
    They shall become great _Princes_ Peeres:
    And, in their _Emblem_, they may know,
    What very day, it will be, so.

See, _Emb._ XLVIII.


49

    You, have attempted many a thing,
    Which, you, to passe, could never bring;
    Not, that, your Worke was hard to doe,
    But, 'cause, you us’d wrong _Meanes_, thereto.
    Hereafter, therefore, learne, I pray,
    The _Times_ of Working, and, the _Way_;
    And, of thine _Emblem_, take thou heed,
    If, better, thou desire to speed.

See, _Emb._ XLIX.


50

    If you, to greater _Wealth_, will rise,
    You must not, slender _Gaine_, despise;
    Nay, if, you minde not, to be poore,
    You must regard slight _Losses_, more:
    For, _Wealth_, and _Poverty_, doe come,
    Not all at once, but, some and some.
    If this, concerne you, any wayes,
    See, what your _Emblem_, further, sayes.

See, _Emb._ L.


51

    Your _Fortune_, hath deserved thank,
    That she, on you, bestowes a _Blank_:
    For, as you, nothing good, have had;
    So, you, have nothing, that is bad.
    Yea, she, in this, hath favour showne,
    (If, now, your _Freedome_ well be knowne)
    For, you, by _Lot_, these _Emblems_, mist,
    That you, may chuse out, which you list.


52

    You, by an _Emblem_, seeke to get
    What Counsel your _Affaires_ may fit;
    But, in particular, there’s none,
    Which, you, by _Lot_, can light upon:
    And, why? because, no _Morall_, there,
    Doth, worthy of your Heed, appeare?
    No; but because you rather, need,
    Of ev’ry _Emblem_, to take heed.


53

    The _Starres_, are, now, no friends of your,
    Or this is not their lucky houre:
    For, at this time, unto your _Lot_,
    They, by an _Emblem_, answer not.
    If, therefore, you desire to know
    What good advice they will allow,
    Some further _Meanes_, you must assay,
    Or, trye your _Chance_, another day.


54

    You, in your secret thoughts, despise
    To thinke an _Emblem_ should advise,
    Or give you cause to minde or heed
    Those things, whereof you may have need:
    And, therefore, when, the _Lot_, you try’d,
    An answer, justly, was deny’d.
    Yet (by your leave) there are but few,
    Who, need good _Counsell_, more then you.


55

    In some extreame, you often are,
    And, shoot too short, or else too farre;
    Yea, such an errour, you were in,
    When, for a _Lot_, you mov’d the _Pin_:
    For, one touch more, or lesse, had layd
    Our _Index_, where it should have stayd.
    But, if you can be warn’d, by this,
    To keepe the _Meane_, which oft you misse,
    You have obtain’d as good a _Lot_,
    As any one, this day, hath got.


56

    Among these _Emblems_, none there be,
    Which, now by _Lot_ will fall to thee;
    However, doe not thou repine:
    For, this doth seeme to be a signe,
    That, thou, thy Portion, shalt advance
    By _Vertue_, not by fickle _Chance_.
    Yet, nerethelesse, despise thou not
    What, by good _Fortune_, may be got.

                                  TO
                          THE HIGH AND MIGHTY
                       Prince, _CHARLES_, Prince
                           _of_ WALES, _&c._

    Fair’st _Blossome_ of our hopes; and _Morning-starre_
    To all these _Ilands_, which inclosed are
    By _Neptunes_ armes, within our Northern _climes_;
    And who (wee trust) shall rise, in future times,
    To be the brightest _Light_, that, then will shine,
    Betwixt the _Artick-Circle_, and the LINE.
      To YOV (as now you are) that I present
    These EMBLEMS, 'tis not so impertinent
    As those may thinke it, who have neither seene
    What, of your _Cradle-sports_, hath heeded beene;
    Nor heard how many serious _Questionings_,
    Your _Child-hood_ frameth, out of trifling things:
    And, if mine aime I have not much mistooke,
    I come not oversoone with such a _Booke_.
      So long as in this _Infant-Age_ you are,
    (Wherein, the speechlesse _Portraitures_ appeare
    A pleasurefull delight) your HIGHNESSE may
    Among our EMBLEMS, finde a _Harmelesse-play_:
    And, those mute _Objects_ will from time to time,
    Still _Riper_, seeme, till you to _ripenesse_ clime.
    When their dumb _Figures_, no more sport can make,
    Their _Illustrations_, will begin to speake;
    And, ev’ry day, new matter still disclose,
    Vntill your _Iudgement_ to perfection growes.
      They likewise, who their _Services_, to do
    Frequent your _Presence_, may have pleasure too,
    From this your _Play-game_: yea, and some perchance,
    May cure a _Folly_, or an _Ignorance_
    By that, which they shall either heare or view
    In these our _Emblems_, when they wait on _You_;
    Or, shall be called, by your EXCELLENCE,
    To try what LOT, they shall obtaine from thence.
      It may, moreover, much increase the sport,
    Which is allowed in a vertuous COVRT;
    When they whose faults have long suspected bin,
    Shall draw forth private Censures of their Sin,
    And, heare their EMBLEMS, openly, display,
    What, others dare not, but in private, say:
    Nor will, to YOV, the MORALS be in vaine,
    Ev’n when to manly Knowledge you attaine;
    For, though to _Teach_, it will not them become
    To be _Remembrancers_, they may presume:
    And, that which in their _Child-hood_, men shall heed,
    Will soonest come to minde, in time of need.
      Incourag’d by these _Hopes_, I thought it meet
    To lay this humble _Present_ at your feet.
    _Accept it, now_; and, please to favour _me_,
    When I growe _old_, and, You a _Man_ shall be.

      _most humbly devoted_,

                                  TO
                          THE MOST HIGH-BORNE
                      and hopeful Prince _JAMES,
                          Duke of YORKE, &c._

Sweet PRINCE,

    Your hand I kisse; and, thus my _Lines_ addresse
    Vnto your wise, and vertuous[A] GOVERNESSE.
      _For, MADAME, (as his PROXY) it is fit,
    That, YOV both =Read=, and =answere= for him, yet.
    To YOV for HIM, J therefore tender, here,
    To welcome-in the =New-beginning Yeare=,
    This harmelesse PLAY-GAME; that, it may have place,
    When somewhat =riper Daies=, shall Make his =GRACE=,
    Affect such =Objects=; which, to looke upon
    May pleasure yeeld him, e’re this =Yeare= be gone.
      'Tis not the least =Discretion=, in great COVRTS,
    To know what =Recreations=, and what =Sports=
    Become young PRINCES; or, to find out those,
    Which may, with harmelesse pleasantnesse, dispose
    Their Mindes to =VERTVE=: neither in their =Cradles=,
    Should this be heeded lesse, than in their =Sadles=:
    Because, when first to =know=, we doe begin,
    A small =Occasion=, lets much =Evill= in.
      Among those things, which both =Instruct= and =please=;
    But few, (for =Children=) are surpassing these:
    For, they, to looke on =Pictures=, much desire;
    And, not to =Looke alone=, but, to enquire
    What things those are, that represented be,
    In ev’ry MAP, or EMBLEM, which they see.
      And, that which they shall =view=, or shall be =told=,
    (By meanes of any =Figure= they behold)
    =Experience= breedes; assisteth =Memory=;
    Or, helps to forme a =Witty Fantasie=:
    And, if those =Formes= to good Instruction tend,
    Oft steads them, also, till their lives have end.
      Then, since ev’n all of us, much Good receive
    By Vertuous PRINCES; And should, therefore, strive
    To adde some =helpes=, whereby they might acquire
    That =Excellence=, which wee in them desire.
    I (being able, to present his GRACE,
    With nothing but a =Rattle=, or a =Glasse=,
    Or some such =Cradle-play-game=) bring, to day,
    This BOOKE, to be as usefull as it may:
    And, =how=, and =when=, it will most =usefull= grow,
    Without my =Teaching=, YOV can fully show.
      For, what is of your =Ablenesse= believ’d,
    Through all these famous =Ilands=, hath receiv’d,
    A large applause; in =that=, from out of those
    Which =ablest= were, both =King= and =State= have chose
    Your =Faith= and =Wisedome=, to be TREASVRESSE
    Of their chiefe =Iewels=; and the GOVERNESSE
    Of our prime Hopes. And, now J this have weigh’d,
    Me thinks, there needs no more, by me, be said,
    But, (having pray’d your HONOVR to receive
    This PRESENT for the DVKE) =to take my leave=;
    And =Versifie= to =him=, some other day,
    When =Hee= can understand mee, what I say._

    Till then, let it please your _Honour_ sometimes to remember
    _Him_, that

I am his Graces

       daily and humble

               Oratour,

    When I observe the Melanchollie _Owles_,
    Considering with what patience, they sustaine
    The many clamours, of the greater _Fowles_;
    And, how the little _Chirpers_, they disdaine:
    When I remember, how, their Injuries
    They sleight, (who, causeles give them an offence)
    Vouchsafing, scarce to cast aside their eyes
    To looke upon that foolish Insolence.
    Me thinkes, by their _Example_, I am taught
    To sleight the slaunders of Injurious _Tongues_;
    To set the scoffes of _Censurers_, at naught,
    And, with a brave _neglect_, to beare out _Wrongs_.
      Hee, doubtles, whom the _Psalmist_, long agoe,
    Vnto a lonely _Desert-Owle_ compar’d,
    Did practise thus; And, when I can doe so,
    I, shall for all affronts, become prepar’d.
    And, (though, this Doctrine, Flesh and blood gaine-say)
    Yet, sure, to stopp the malice of _Despight_,
    There is no better, (nay, no other) way:
    Since, _Rage_ by Opposition gathers _Might_.
      _Good =God=! vouchsafe, sufficient grace and strength,
    That (though I have not yet, such =Patience= gott)
    I may attaine this happy gift, at length;
    And, finde the cause, that, yet, I have it not.
    Though me, my =Neighbours=, and my =Foes= revile;
    Make me of all their words, a =Patient-bearer=:
    When er’e I =suffer=, let me be, the while,
    As is the silent =Lambe= before the =Shearer=.
      So; though my =speakings=, cannot quiet any,
      My =Patience= may restraine the Tongues of many._

    The _Crowe_, when deepe within a close-mouth’d-_Pot_.
    She water finds, her thirstinesse to slake;
    (And, knoweth not where else it might be got)
    Her _Belly_, teacheth her, this course to take:
    She flies, and fetcheth many _Pibbles_ thither,
    Then, downe into the _Vessell_, lets them _drop_;
    Vntill, so many stones are brought together,
    As may advance the water to the top.
      From whence, we might this _observation_ heed;
    That, _Hunger_, _Thirst_, and those _necessities_,
    (Which from the _Bellies_ craving, doe proceed)
    May make a _Foole_, grow provident and wise.
    And, though (in sport) we say, the _braines_ of some,
    Not in their _Heads_, but in their _Gutts_, doe lye;
    Yet, that, by wants, Men wiser should become,
    Dissenteth not from true _Philosophy_:
    For, no man labours with much _Willingnesse_,
    To compasse, what he nought at all desires;
    Nor seeketh so, his longing to possesse,
    As, when some urgent neede, the same requires.
    Nay, though he might, a _willingnesse_, retaine,
    Yet, as the _Belly_, which is ever full,
    Breeds fumes, that cause a _sottish-witles-braine_;
    So, _plenteous Fortunes_, make the _Spirits_ dull.
    All, _borne to Riches_, have not _all-times_, witt
    To keepe, (much lesse, to better) their degree:
    But, men to nothing borne, oft, passage get.
    (Through many wants) renown’d, and rich to bee:
      Yea, _Povertie_ and _Hunger_, did produce,
      The best _Inventions_, and, of chiefest use.

    To _Musicke_, and the Muses, many beare
    Much hatred; and, to whatsoever ends
    Their _Soule-delighting-Raptures_ tuned are,
    Such peevish dispositions, it offends.
    Some others, in a _Morall way_, affect
    Their pleasing _Straines_ (or, for a sensuall use)
    But, in _Gods Worship_, they the same suspect;
    (Or, taxe it rather) as a great abuse.
    The _First_ of these, are full of _Melancholy_;
    And, Pitty need, or Comfort, more then blame;
    And, soone, may fall into some dangerous _folly_,
    Vnlesse they labour, to prevent the same.
    The _Last_, are _giddie-things_, that have befool’d
    Their Iudgements, with _beguiling-Fantasies_,
    Which (if they be not, by discretion, school’d)

    The _Fryers Habit_, seemeth to import,
    That, thou (as ancient _Monkes_ and _Fryers_ did)
    Shouldst live remote, from places of resort,
    And, in _retyrednesse_, lye closely hid.
    The _clasped-Booke_, doth warne thee, to retaine
    Thy _thoughts_ within the compasse of thy breast;
    And, in a quiet _silence_ to remaine,
    Vntill, thy minde may safely be exprest.
    That _Anchor_, doth informe thee, that thou must
    Walke on in _Hope_; and, in thy Pilgrimage,
    Beare up (without _despairing_ or _distrust_)
    Those wrongs, and sufferings, which attend thine _Age_.
      For, whensoere _Oppression_ groweth rife,
    _Obscurenesse_, is more safe than _Eminence_;
    Hee, that then keepes his _Tongue_, may keepe his _Life_,
    Till Times will better favour _Innocence_.
    _Truth_ spoken where _untruth_ is more approved,
    Will but enrage the malice of thy foes;
    And, otherwhile, a wicked man is moved
    To cease from wrong, if no man him oppose.

    Thy life in safe _Retyrednesse_, to spend:
    Let, in thy breast, thy thoughts reserved bee,
    Till thou art layd, where none can thee offend.

    In all their friendly meetings, I was one;

    By day or night, I seldome sate alone;

      But, where are now those multitudes of _Friends_?
    Alas! they on a sudden flasht away.

    Which fayling them, it would no longer stay.
    If I to vaine expences, would have mov’d them,

    For, proud of their owne powre, they sometimes grow,
    And quarrell, till _themselves_ they overthrow.
    Nor, doe the chiefest _glories_, of a _Land_,
    In many _Cities_, or much _People_, stand:
    For, then, those _Kingdomes_, most renowned were,
    In which _Vnchristian Kings_, and, _Tyrants_ are.
      It is the _King_ by whom a _Realme’s_ renowne,
    Is either builded up, or overthrowne.
    By _Solomon_, more fam’d was _Iudah_ made,
    Then, by the Multitude of men it had:
    Great _Alexander_, glorified _Greece_,
    Throughout the World, which, else had bene a piece
    Perhaps obscure; And, _Cæsar_ added more
    To _Rome_, then all her greatnesse did before.
      _Grant, =Lord=, these =Iles=, for ever may be blessed,

    I Thinke you would be wise; for, most men seeme
    To make of _Knowledge_ very great esteeme.
    If such be your desires, this _Emblem_ view;
    And, marke how well the _Figures_, counsell you.
    Wee by the Bird of _Athens_, doe expresse,
    That painefull, and that usefull _watchfulnesse_,
    Which ought to bee enjoyned, unto them,
    Who seeke a place, in _Wisdomes_ Academ.
    For, as an _Owle_ mewes up her selfe by _Day_,
    And watcheth in the _Night_, to get her prey;
    Ev’n so, good _Students_, neither must be such,
    As _daily_ gad; or _nightly_ sleepe too much.
      That _open-booke_, on which the _Owle_ is perch’d,
    Affords a _Morall_, worthy to be search’d:
    For, it informes, and, darkly doth advise,
    Your _Watchings_ be not after Vanities;
    (Or, like their _Wakings_, who turne dayes to nights,
    In following their unlawfull appetites)
    And, that, in keeping Home, you doe not spend
    Your houres in sloth, or, to some fruitlesse end.
    But, rather in good _Studies_; and, in that,
    By which, true _Knowledge_, is arrived at.
    For, if your _Studies_, and your _Wakings_, bee
    To this intent; you shall that _Path-way_ see
    To _Wisdome_, and to _Honour_, which was found,
    Of them, whose _Knowledge_ hath been most renownd.
    But, if your _Watchings_, and _Retyrednesse_,
    Be for your _Lust_, or, out of _Sottishnesse_;
      You are not, what th' _Athenian-Owle_ implies,
      But, what our _English-Owlet_ signifies.

    It prospers ever best, in all Estates,
    When _Mars_ and _Pallas_ are continuall Mates.
    And, those affaires but seldome luckie be,
    In which, these needfull _Powers_, doe not agree.
    That _Common-wealth_, in which, good _Arts_ are found
    Without a _Guard_, will soone receive a wound:
    And, _Souldiers_, where _good-order_ beares no sway,
    Will, very quickly, rout themselves away.
      Moreover, in our private Actions too,
    There must bee both a _Knowledge_, how to doe
    The _worke_ propos’d; and _strength_ to finish it;
    Or, wee shall profit little by our _Wit_.
    _Discretion_ takes effect, where _Vigour_ failes;
    Where _Cunning_ speeds not, _outward-force_ prevailes;
    And, otherwhile, the prize pertaines to neither,
    Till they have joyn’d their _Vertues_ both together.
      Consider this; and, as occasions are,
    To both of these your due respects declare.
    Delight not so in _Arts_, to purchase harmes
    By Negligence, or Ignorance of _Armes_:
    If _Martiall-Discipline_ thou shalt affect;
    Yet, doe not _honest-Policie_, neglect.
    Improve thy _Minde_, as much as e’re thou may;
    But foole thou not thy _Bodies_ gifts away.
    The _Vertues_ both of _Body_, and of _Mind_,
    Are, still, to be regarded in their kind.
    And, wee should neither of the two disgrace;
    Nor, either of them, raise above his place:
      For, when these two wee value as wee ought,
      Great works, by their _joynt-power_, to passe are brought.

    Marke well this _Emblem_; and, observe you thence
    The nature of true _Christian-confidence_.
    Her _Foot_ is fixed on a _squared-Stone_,
    Which, whether side soe’re you turne it on,
    Stands fast; and, is that _Corner-stone_, which props,
    And firmely knits the structure of our _Hopes_.
      _Shee_, alwayes, beares a _Crosse_; to signifie,
    That, there was never any _Constancie_
    Without her _Tryalls_: and, that, her perfection,
    Shall never be attain’d, without _Affliction_.
      A _Cup_ shee hath, moreover, in her hand;
    And, by that _Figure_, thou mayst understand,
    That, shee hath draughts of _Comfort_, alwayes neere her,
    (At ev’ry brunt) to strengthen, and to cheare her.
    And, loe, _her_ head is _crown’d_; that, we may see
    How great, her _Glories_, and _Rewards_, will be.
      Hereby, this _Vertue’s_ nature may be knowne:
    Now, practise, how to make the same thine owne.
    Discourag’d be not, though thou art pursu’d
    With many wrongs, which cannot be eschew’d;
    Nor yeeld thou to _Despairing_, though thou hast
    A _Crosse_ (which threatens death) to be embrac’t;
    Or, though thou be compell’d to swallow up,
    The very dregs, of _Sorrowes_ bitter _Cup_:
    For, whensoever griefes, or torments, paine thee,
    Thou hast the same _Foundation_ to sustaine thee:
    The selfe same _Cup_ of _Comfort_, is prepared
    To give thee strength, when _fainting-fits_ are feared:
      And, when thy _time of tryall_, is expired,
      Thou shalt obtaine the _Crowne_, thou hast desired.

    I'le hereby teach you (_Ladies_) to discover
    A true-bred _Cupid_, from a fained _Lover_;
    And, shew (if you have Wooers) which be they,
    That worth’est are to beare your _Hearts_ away.
      As is the _Boy_, which, here, you pictured see,
    Let them be _young_, or let them, rather, be
    Of _suiting-yeares_ (which is instead of _youth_)
    And, wooe you in the _nakednesse_, of _Truth_;
    Not in the common and disguised _Clothes_,
    Of _Mimick-gestures_, _Complements_, and _Oathes_.
    Let them be _winged_ with a swift _Desire_;
    And, not with _slow-affections_, that will tyre.
    But, looke to this, as to the principall,
    That, _Love_ doe make them truly _Musicall_:
    For, _Love’s_ a good _Musician_; and, will show
    How, every faithfull _Lover_ may be so.
      Each _word_ he speakes, will presently appeare
    To be melodious _Raptures_ in your eare:
    Each _gesture_ of his body, when he moves,
    Will seeme to _play_, or _sing_, a _Song of Loves_:
    The very _lookes_, and _motions_ of his eyes,
    Will touch your _Heart-strings_, with sweet _Harmonies_;
    And, if the _Name_ of him, be but exprest,
    T’will cause a thousand _quaverings_ in your breast.
    Nay, ev’n those _Discords_, which occasion’d are,
    Will make your _Musicke_, much the sweeter, farre.

    What may the reason be, so many wed,
    And misse the blessings of a _joyfull-Bed_,

    For which, this Age most _Marriages_ intends?
    Some, love _plumpe flesh_; and, those as kinde will be
    To any gamesome _Wanton_, as to thee.
    Some, doate on _Honours_; and, all such will prize
    Thy _Person_, meerely, for thy _Dignities_.
    Some, fancy _Pleasures_; and, such _Flirts_ as they,
    With ev’ry _Hobby-horse_, will runne away.
    Some (like this _Couple_ in our _Emblem_, here)
    Wooe hard for _Wealth_; and, very kind appeare,
    Till they have wonne their prize: but, then they show
    On what their best _Affections_ they bestow.
      This _Wealth_, is that sweet _Beautie_, which preferres
    So many to their _Executioners_.
    This, is that rare _Perfection_, for whose sake,
    The _Politician_, doth his _Marriage_, make.
    Yea, most of those whom you shall married find,
    Were cousned, (or did cousen) in this kind;
    And, for some _by-spects_, they came together,
    Much more, than for the sakes, of one another.
    If this concernes thee, now, in any sense;
    For thy instruction, take this warning hence:
    If thou hast err’d already, then, lament
    Thy passed crime, and, beare thy punishment.
    If thou, as yet, but tempted art to erre;

    Or, else, that common _dulnesse_ overtakes them,
    Which makes ashamed, that it should be thought,

    Which is not, here, below, to be attain’d;

    These, are the great’st _Afflictions_, most men have,
    Ev’n from their _Nursing-cradle_, to their _Grave_:
    Yet, both so needfull are, I cannot see,
    How either of them, may well spared bee.
    The _Rod_ is that, which, most our _Child-hood_ feares;
    And, seemes the great’st _Affliction_ that it beares:
    That, which to _Man-hood_, is a plague, as common
    (And, more unsufferable) is a _Woman_.
      Yet, blush not _Ladies_; neither frowne, I pray,
    That, thus of _Women_, I presume to say;

    (Which, else, had beene a trimming, to their House)
    They, sometimes prove, sharpe _whips_, and _Rods_, to them,
    That _Wisdome_, and _Instruction_ doe contemne.
      A _Woman_, was not given for _Correction_;
    But, rather for a furtherance to _Perfection_:
    A precious _Balme of love_, to cure Mans griefe;
    And, of his Pleasures, to become the chiefe.
    If, therefore, she occasion any smart,

    May partly show; and, let my _Reader_, see
    The state, of an _Immutable-decree_;
    And, how it differs, from those _Destinies_,
    Which carnall understandings, doe devise.
      For, this implies, that ev’ry thing, _to-come_,
    Was, by a steady, and, by equall _doome_,
    Weigh’d out, by _Providence_; and, that, by _Grace_,
    Each _thing_, each _person_, ev’ry _time_, and _place_,
    Had thereunto, a _powre_, and _portion_ given,
    So proper to their nature (and, so even
    To that just _measure_, which, aright became
    The _Workings_, and, the _being_, of the same)
    As, best might helpe the furthering of that _end_,
    Which, _God’s_ eternall _wisedome_, doth intend.
    And, though, I dare not be so bold, as they,
    Who, of _God’s_ Closet, seeme to keep the _Key_;
    (And, things, for absolute _Decrees_, declare,
    Which, either _false_, or, but _Contingents_ are)
    Yet, in his _Will-reveal’d_, my _Reason_, sees
    Thus much, of his _Immutable-decrees_:
    That, him, a _Doome-eternall_, reprobateth,
    Who scorneth _Mercie_; or, _Instruction_ hateth,
    Without _Repenting_: And, that, whensoever,
    A _Sinner_, true _amendment_, shall indeavour;
    Bewaile his _Wickednesse_, and, call for _grace_;
    There shall be, for _Compassion_, time, and place.
      And, this, I hold, a branch of that _Decree_,

    Some _freedomes_ lacke, which, are desired, now;
    And, though, thy _Body_ be not so confin’d;
    Art straitned, from some liberty of _Minde_.
      The _Bird in thrall_, the more contented lyes,
    Because, the _Hawke_, so neere her, she espyes;

      Not _Precepts_, but _Experience_, thus hath taught me;
    Which, to such resolutions, now have brought me,
    That, whatsoever mischiefes others doe me,
    I make them yield some true Contentments to me;
    And, seldome struggle from them, till I see,
    That, _smother-fortunes_ will securer be.
    What spight soere my Foes, to me, can doe,
    I laugh thereat, within an houre or two;
    For, though the World, and I, at first, believe,
    My Suffrings, give me cause enough to grieve;

      Thus fares the man, whom _Vertue_, Beacon-like,
    Hath fixt upon the _Hills_ of Eminence,
    At him, the Tempests of mad _Envie_ strike,
    And, rage against his Piles of Innocence;

    They seeke to keepe his worth from being knowne,
    They, daily, make it greater, then before;
    And, cause his _Fame_, the farther to be blowne.
      When, therefore, no selfe-doting _Arrogance_,

    Breake through _obscurity_, and, thee advance

      But, Conscience make of raysing your estates,

    Which, neither shall have _End_, nor, was _begunne_.
    BEGINNING, is the _next_; which, is a space
    (Or moment rather) scarce imaginarie,
    Made, when the first _Material_, formed was;
    And, then, forbidden, longer time to tarry.
    TIME entred, when, BEGINNING had an _Ending_,
    And, is a Progresse, all the workes of _Nature_,
    Within the circuit of it, comprehending,
    Ev’n till the _period_, of the _Outward-creature_.
    END, is the _fourth_, of those five _Termes_ I meane;
    (As briefe, as was _Beginning_) and, ordayned,
    To set the last of _moments_, to that _Scæne_,
    Which, on this Worlds wide _Stage_, is entertayned.
    The _fifth_, we EVERLASTING, fitly, call;
    For, though, it once _begunne_, yet, shall it never
    Admit, of any _future-end_, at all;
    But, be extended onward, still, for ever.
      The knowledge of these _Termes_, and of what _actions_,
    To each of them belongs, would set an end,
    To many Controversies, and Distractions,
    Which doe so many trouble, and offend.
    TIME’S nature, by the _Fading-flowre_, appeares;
    Which, is a _Type_, of Transitory things:

    We doe acknowledge (as this _Emblem_ showes)
    That _Fruits_ and _Flowres_, and many _pleasant-things_,
    From out the _Ground_, in ev’ry season growes;
    And, that unto their _being_, helpe it brings.
    Yet, of it selfe, the _Ground_, we know is dull,
    And, but a _Willing-patient_, whereupon
    The _Sunne_, with Beames, and Vertues wonderfull,
    Prepareth, and effecteth, what is done.
    We, likewise, doe acknowledge, that our _eyes_
    Indowed are with faculties of _Seeing_,
    And, with some other nat’rall _properties_,
    Which are as much our owne, as is our _Being_.
    However, till the _Sunne_ imparts his light,
    We finde, that we in _darkenesse_ doe remaine,
    Obscured in an everlasting night;
    And, boast our _Seeing-faculties_, in vaine.
      So, we, by nature, have some nat’rall powers:
    But, _Grace_, must those abilities of ours
    First move; and, guide them, still, in moving, thus,
    To worke with _God_, when _God_ shall worke on us:
    For, _God_ so workes, that, no man he procures
    Against his _nature_, ought to chuse, or shun:
    But, by his _holy-Spirit_, him allures;
    And, with sweet mildnesse, proveth ev’ry one.
    The _Sunne_ is faultlesse of it, when the birth
    Of some bad _Field_, is nothing else but _Weeds_:
    For, by the selfe-same _Sun-shine_, fruitfull Earth
    Beares pleasant Crops, and plentifully breeds.
      Thus, from our _selves_, our _Vices_ have increase,
      Our _Vertues_, from the _Sunne_ of _Righteousnesse_.

    Abroad, more famous then _Bucephalus_,
    Though, not so knowne, as _Banks_ his horse, with us;
    Or some of those _fleet-horses_, which of late,
    Have runne their _Masters_, out of their estate.
    For, those, and _Hobby-horses_, best befit
    The note, and practice of their moderne wit,
    Who, what this _Horse_ might meane, no knowledge had,
    Vntill, a _Taverne-signe_, they saw it made.
      Yet, this old _Emblem_ (worthy veneration)
    Doth figure out, that _winged-contemplation_,
    On which the _Learned_ mount their best _Invention_,
    And, climbe the _Hills_ of highest Apprehension.
    This is the nimble _Gennet_, which doth carry,
    Their _Fancie_, thorow _Worlds_ imaginary;
    And, by _Idæas_ feigned, shewes them there,
    The nature of those _Truths_, that reall are.
    By meanes of _this_, our _Soules_ doe come to know
    A thousand secrets, in the _Deeps_ below;
    Things, here on _Earth_, and, things above the _Skyes_,
    On which, we never fixed, yet, our eyes.
      No thorny, miery, steepe, nor craggy place,
    Can interrupt this _Courser_, in his race:
    For, that, which others, in their passage troubles,
    Augments his courage, and his vigour doubles.

    The painfull _Husbandman_, with sweaty browes,
    Consumes in labour many a weary day:
    To breake the stubborne earth, he _digs_ and _ploughes_,
    And, then, the Corne, he scatters on the clay:
    When that is done, he _harrowes_ in the Seeds,
    And, by a well-cleans’d Furrow, layes it drye:
    He, frees it from the _Wormes_, the _Moles_, the _Weeds_;
    He, on the _Fences_, also hath an eye.
    And, though he see the chilling Winter, bring
    _Snowes_, _Flouds_, and _Frosts_, his Labours to annoy;
    Though _blasting-windes_ doe nip them in the _Spring_,
    And, _Summers_ Meldewes, threaten to destroy:
    Yea, though not onely _Dayes_, but _Weekes_, they are
    (Nay, many _Weekes_, and, many _Moneths_ beside)
    In which he must with payne, prolong his care,
    Yet, constant in his hopes he doth abide.
    For this respect, HOPE’S _Emblem_, here, you see
    Attends the _Plough_, that men beholding it,
    May be instructed, or else minded be,
    What Hopes, continuing _Labours_, will befit.
    Though, long thou toyled hast, and, long attended
    About such workings as are necessary;
    And, oftentimes, ere fully they are ended,
    Shalt finde thy paines in danger to miscarry:
    Yet, be not out of _hope_, nor quite dejected:
    For, buryed Seeds will sprout when _Winter’s_ gone;
    Vnlikelier things are many times effected;
    And, _God_ brings helpe, when men their best have done.

    That _leisurely-proceeding_, which may bring

    Some other over-much, of late,
    To thy dishonour boldly prate,

    Thine _Emblem_, therefore, doth advise

    By such as know you, it is thought,

    That _Emblem_, which by _Lot_ you drew,

    To feed your _Bowells_, by your _Braine_.

    Beginnes to blow _Affection’s_ fire;

    Lest, it consume you, at the last;
    Or, by the fury of the same,
    Blow out some necessary _Flame_.
    Yea, that, which doth your _Profit_ breed,
    May harme you, if you take not heed.

See, _Emb._ VI.

    Be carefull, what you goe about;
    For, by this _Lot_, there may be doubt,
    That you, some wickednesse intend,
    Which will undoe you, in the end.
    If you have done the _deed_, repent:
    If purpos’d ill, the same prevent.
    Else, though in _jest_, this _Counsell_ came,
    In _earnest_, you may rue the same.

    What thing soere thou undertak’st,
    Thou seldome good conclusion mak’st;
    For, still, when thou hast ought to doe,
    Thou art too _hasty_, or too _slow_;
    And, from that equall temper stray’st,
    By which, thy worke effect thou mayst.
    To mend this fault thou counsell’d art,
    Be wiser, therefore, then thou wert.

See, _Emb._ X.


11

    Thou hast in publicke lived long,
    And, over freely us’d thy _tongue_;
    But, if thy safety thou desire,
    Be _silent_, and, thy selfe _retire_.
    And, if thou wilt not be undone,
    Possesse thy _joyes_, and _hopes_, alone:
    For, they, that will from harmes be free,
    Must _silent_, and _obscured_, bee.

See, _Emb._ XI.

    Thy _Fortune_, thou dost long to heare,
    And, what thy _Constellations_ are:
    But, why should’st thou desire to know,
    What things, the _Planets_ doe foreshow;
    Seeke, rather, _Wisedome_ to procure,
    And, how, all _Fortunes_ to indure:
    So, thou shalt gaine a blest estate,
    And, be the _Master_ of thy _Fate_.

See, _Emb._ XII.


13

    Thou, seem’st to have great store of _friends_,
    But, they affect thee, for their ends.
    There is, in those, but little trust,
    Who love, for _profit_, _mirth_, or _lust_.
    Learne, therfore, when, thou mayst be sure,
    Thy _Friend’s_ affection will indure;
    And, that this _Knowledge_ may be got,
    Good notice take thou of thy _Lot_.

See, _Emb._ XIII.


14

    It is conceiv’d, that meanes thou hast,
    Or, might’st have had good meanes, at least,
    To bring those matters to effect,
    Which thou dost carelesly neglect;
    And, good for many might’st have done,
    Who, yet, hast pleasur’d few, or none.
    If this be true, thy _Lot_ peruse,
    And, _God’s_ good gifts, no more abuse.

See, _Emb._ XIV.


15

    Religious thou would’st faine be deem’d,
    And, such, to many thou hast seem’d:
    But, to this matter more there goes,
    Then zealous lookes, and formall showes.
    Looke, therefore, that thy heart be true,
    What e’re thou seeme in outward view.
    And, if _God’s_ favour thou would’st have,
    Observe what _Off’rings_, he doth crave.

    That _Emblem_, which this _Lot_ will bring,
    Concernes the honour of a _King_:
    How, therefore, thee it may concerne,
    By thy discretion seeke to learne.
    Perhaps, the _Royall-powre_ hath seem’d
    To thee, not so to be esteem’d,
    As well it merits, to be priz’d.
    If so, now better be advis’d.

See, _Emb._ XVI.


17

    Both learn’d, and wise, thou would’st become,
    (Else thou hast much deceived some)
    But, if thy _hopes_ thou will effect,
    Thou must not likely _meanes_ neglect;
    And, what the likelyest _meanes_ may bee,
    Thine _Emblem_ hath advised thee:
    For, by a _Fowle_, that’s blockish thought,
    Good _counsell_ may to thee be taught.

See, _Emb._ XVII.


18

    If, to _preferment_ thou wilt rise,
    Thou must not _Arts_, nor _Armes_, despise;
    Nor so in _one_ of these delight,
    That, thou the _other_, wholly sleight.
    Nor, to thy _Body_ be inclin’d,
    So much, as to neglect thy _Minde_.
    This, by thine _Emblem_, thou mayst learne;
    And, much thy good it may concerne.

See, _Emb._ XVIII.


19

    Thy _fortunes_ have appeared bad;
    For, many _suff’rings_ thou hast had:
    And _tryalls_ too, as yet made knowne
    To no mans knowledge, but thine owne.
    But, let nor losse, nor fame, nor smart,
    From constant hopes remove thy heart:
    And, as thine _Emblem_ doth foreshew,
    A good conclusion will insue.

See, _Emb._ XIX.


_W_ 20

    Your _Lot_ informeth how to know
    Where, best your _Love_ you may bestow:
    And, by the same it may appeare
    What _Musicke_ most affects your eare.
    Denye it not; for (by your leave)
    Wee by your lookes, your heart perceive.
    And, this perhaps you’l thinke upon
    (To purpose) when you are alone.

See, _Emb._ XX.


21

    This _Lot_ may make us all suspect,
    That some wrong _object_ you affect;
    And, that, where dearenesse you pretend,
    It is not for the noblest end.
    What mischiefe from such falshood flowes,
    Your _Emblem_ very truely showes;
    And, may more happy make your _Fate_,
    If counsell be not come too late.

See, _Emb._ XXI.


22

    To trust on others, thou art apt;
    And, hast already beene intrapt;
    Or, may’st er’e long be much deceiv’d
    By some, whom thou hast well believ’d.
    Be heedfull, therfore, of thy _Lot_;
    And, let it never be forgot:
    So, though some hazzard thou mayst run,
    Yet, thou shalt never be undone.

See, _Emb._ XXII.


23

    It seemes thou tak’st too great a care
    For things, that vaine, and fading are;
    Or else, dost overprise them so,
    As if all blisse from them did flowe.
    That, therefore, thou mayst view their worth,
    In _Hieroglyphicke_ shaddow’d forth,
    Thy _Lot_ befriends thee: marke the same,
    And, be in this, no more to blame.

See, _Emb._ XXIII.


24

    Though some, should thee, for one, mistake,
    Whose _wealth_ is all upon his backe,
    If what thou hast, bee all thine owne,
    God, hath enough on thee bestowne.
    A _Princes_ ransome, wee may beare,
    In _Iewells_, which most precious are;
    And, yet, to many men may seeme,
    To carry nothing worth esteeme.
    Therefore, though small thy substance be,
    Thine _Emblem_, somewhat comforts thee.

See, _Emb._ XXIV.


25

    By this your _Emblem_, wee discerne,
    That, you are yet of age to learne;
    And, that, when elder you shall grow,
    There, will be more for you to _know_:
    Presume not, therefore of your _wit_,
    But, strive that you may benefit.
    For, of your age, we many view,
    That, farre more _wisedome_ have, then you.

See, _Emb._ XXV.


26

    By thy complaints, it hath appear’d,
    Thou think’st thy _Vertues_ want reward;
    And, that, if they their merit had,
    Thou _rich_, and _nobler_ should’st be made.
    To drive thee from that partiall thought,
    Thou, by an _Emblem_, shalt be taught,
    That, where true _Vertue_ may be found,
    The truest _wealth_ will still abound.

See, _Emb._ XXVI.


27

    By this thy _Lot_, thou dost appeare
    To be of those, who love to heare
    The _Preacher’s_ voyce; or, else of them,
    That undervalue, or contemne
    Those dayly _showres_ of wholsome _words_,
    Which _God_, in these our times, affords.
    Now, which soere of these thou bee,
    Thine _Emblem_, something, teaches thee.

See, _Emb._ XXVII.


28

    Thou deal’st, when thee thy _foe_ offends,
    As if, you never should be _friends_.
    In _peace_, thou so secure doth grow,
    As if, thou could’st not have a _foe_.
    How, therefore, _Peace_ and _Warre_ pursues
    Each other, this thine _Emblem_ shewes,
    That, thou mayst learne, in ev’ry tide,
    For future chances, to provide.

See, _Emb._ XXVIII.


29

    What e’re thou are in outward shew,
    Thy Heart is ever very true,
    And, to those _Knowledges_ aspires,
    Which every prudent _Soule_ desires:
    Yet, be not proud that thou hast got
    This testimonie, by thy _Lot_.
    But, view thine _Emblem_, and endeaver
    In search of _Knowledge_ to persever.

See, _Emb._ XXIX.


30

    If _Glory_, thou desire to get,
    Thy _Wits_, thou must on working set;
    And, _labour_ unto _Prudence_ adde,
    Before true _Honor_ will be had:
    For, what thy _Friends_, or _Parents_ brought,
    To make thee _famous_, profits nought;
    But, rather will procure thy _shame_,
    Vnlesse, thou shalt improove the same.

See, _Emb._ XXX.


_M_ 31

    The time hath beene, that of the _Rod_,
    Thou wert more fearefull, then of _God_;
    But, now unlesse thou prudent grow,
    More cause thou hast to feare a _shrowe_;
    For, from the _Rod_, now thou art free,
    A _Woman_, shall thy torment be.
    At her, yet doe not thou repine,
    For, all the fault is onely thine.

See, _Emb._ XXXI.


32

    It seemes, thy _Time_ thou dost _mispend_:
    To warne thee, therefore of thine end;
    To shew, how short thy _Life_ will be;
    And, with what speed it flyes from thee;
    This _Lot_ was drawne: and, may advize,
    That, thou thy time shouldst better prize.
    Which, if accordingly thou doe,
    This, will be _sport_, and profit too.

See, _Emb._ XXXII.


33

    It may be, thou art one of those,
    Who, dost not all aright suppose,
    Of _Gods Decrees_; or, of the state
    Of an inevitable _Fate_.
    That, therefore, so thou maist beleeve,
    (And, of these Mysteries conceive)
    As thou art bound; this _Lot_ befell.
    Peruse, and minde thine _Embleme_ well.

See, _Emb._ XXXIII.


34

    Thou, at thy _Fortune_, hast repin’d,
    And, seem’st imprisond in thy minde,
    Because thou art not straight releast
    From those things which have thee opprest.
    To thee, a _Lot_ is therefore sent,
    To qualifie thy _discontent_,
    By shewing, that thy present _Fate_
    Preserves thee, from a worse estate.

See, _Emb._ XXXIV.


35

    Thy _Vertues_ and thy _Worth_ are such,
    That, many doe envie thee much;
    And, they that hate thee, take delight
    To doe thee mischiefe and despight.
    But, heart assume, and follow on
    The _course_ that thou hast well begunne;
    For, all their spight shall doe no more,
    But, make thee greater then before.

See, _Emb._ XXXV.


36

    In outward pompe, thy pleasures are;
    Thy hope of blisse is placed there;
    And, thou this _folly_ wilt not leave,
    Till, all _content_, it shall bereave,
    Vnlesse, thou timely come to see
    How vaine, all earthly _Glories_ bee.
    An _Emblem_, therefore, thou hast gain’d,
    By which, this _Knowledge_ is obtain’d.

See, _Emb._ XXXVI.


37

    It may be feared, that thou hast
    In publicke, or in private, past
    Some _promise_, or else made some _vow_,
    That’s broke, or else indanger’d, now.
    If so; this _Lot_ is come, in time,
    To mend, or to prevent this crime;
    And, shew what should by them be done,
    'Twixt whom _Affection_ is begunne.

See, _Emb._ XXXVII.


38

    Thou art reproved of _deceipt_,
    In faulty _Measures_, and in _Weight_;
    And, overbackward hast been knowne,
    In giving ev’ry one his owne.
    Thine _Emblem_, therefore, counsells thee,
    That, thou more just, hereafter be.
    For, that, which is by _falsehood_ got,
    Makes likely showes, but prospers not.

See, _Emb._ XXXVII.


39

    So highly, thou dost _Vertue_ prize,
    That, thou dost _Fortunes_ helpe despise,
    As if, where _Vertues_ present are,
    Her favours alwayes needlesse were:
    But, sometimes there’s enough to doe,
    For _Fortune_, and for _Vertue_ too,
    The pow’r of envious tongues to charme,
    And, keepe an _Innocent_ from harme.
    Therfore, make both of _these_, thy friends;
    For, thereunto thine _Emblem_ tends.

See, _Emb._ XXXIX.


40

    Thou mayst be one of those, perchance,
    Who _Schisme_, and _Heresies_ advance,
    Because they _Times_ and _Termes_ mistake;
    And, _diff’rence_ know not how to make
    'Twixt that, which _temp’rall_ doth appeare,
    And, those things which _eternall_ are.
    Thou, by thy _Lot_, art therefore warn’d,
    To search what should of these be learn’d.

See, _Emb._ XL.


41

    Great workes to doe, thou hast a _minde_;
    But, _pow’r_ thereto thou canst not finde.
    Sometime, thy _pow’r_ is not unfit;
    But, then thou failest in thy _wit_.
    Such _Vndertakings_, therefore, chuse
    (If thou wilt not thy time abuse)
    As to thy _pow’rs_, and _wits_ agree;
    And, let them both imployed bee.
                    See, _Emb._ XLI.


42

    When any _Blessing_ thou hast gain’d,
    Thou mind’st not whence it was obtain’d;
    But, bear’st thy selfe, as if the same
    By thine owne _pow’r_, or _merit_, came:
    That, therefore, thou _mayst_ better heed
    From whence, all _Graces_ doe proceed,
    Thou, hast an _Emblem_, by this _Lot_,
    From which, good _Cautions_ may be got.

See, _Emb._ XLII.


43

    By this thy _Lot_, it should appeare,
    The _Muses_ thy acquaintance are;
    Or, that thou art (at least) of those,
    Who, of their _Steed_ ambitious growes.
    If thou hast _wit_, his _Reynes_ to guide,
    Vpon his backe, mount up and ride;
    But, if thou finde thy selfe to weake,
    Forbeare him, lest thy necke he breake.

See, _Emb._ XLIII.


44

    In many things, the worse thou art,
    By thy despayring, fainting heart;
    And, oft, thy labour, and thy cost,
    For want of _hopefulnesse_, is lost.
    This indiscretion to prevent,
    Thou, therefore, by thy _Lot_, art sent,
    The _Plough-man’s_ hopefulnesse to see:
    Observe it; and, reformed bee.

See, _Emb._ XLIV.


45

    As soone as e’re thy _Seeds_ are sowne,
    Thou _fruits_ expectest, fully growne.
    And, if they ripe not in a day,
    Thou, foolest all thy hopes away:
    That wiser, therefore, thou mayst grow,
    Thy _Lot_, an _Emblem_ doth bestow,
    To teach, that _workes_ both faire and great,
    By _small-degrees_, are made compleat.

See, _Emb._ XLV.


46

    Thou hadst, or hast, or thou shalt have
    Much trouble, ere thou fill thy _Grave_;
    And, may’st, when thou expectest rest,
    With paine, or sorrowes, be opprest.
    But, be content, and waile not much:
    For, _Poverty_ shall make thee _rich_.
    The paine will soone be overpast,
    And, thou shalt happy be at last.

See, _Emb._ XLVI.


47

    Thy _Fortune_, be it good or bad,
    May, by thy _wit_, be better made;
    Yea, whatsoere _mischances_ fall,
    By _prudence_, thou may’st helpe them all.
    That, hopefull, therfore, thou mayst bide,
    What change soever, shall betide,
    Thou, by thy _Lot_, informed art,
    What succours, _Wisedome_ doth impart.

    A man at _Armes_, thou wouldst be thought,
    And, hast the Crowne of _Honour_ sought;
    But, thou hast much mistooke the _wayes_,
    Which tend to well-deserved _praise_.
    How, _Honour_, therefore, may be got,
    Thou art informed by thy _Lot_;
    And, with what _Foes_, and, for what _end_,
    Thou shouldst be ready to contend.

See, _Emb._ XLVIII.


49

    Perhaps, thou mayst be one of those,
    Who doth _God’s_ holy Church oppose;
    For, over many in these dayes,
    Disturbe her _Peace_, and sleight her _Praise_:
    That her _esteeme_, therefore may bee
    Increased, or preserv’d, by thee,
    Thine _Emblem_, now, to thee, will show,
    To what perfection she will grow.

See, _Emb._ XLIX.


50

    Thou _safety_ lov’st, and wouldst have _Armes_,
    Thy person to secure from harmes:
    But, most of those thou hast prepar’d,
    Are but a weake uncertaine _Guard_,
    And, if thou take not greater heed,
    May faile thy trust, in time of need.
    Thine _Emblem_, therfore, hath exprest,
    What _Armes_, for thy defence are best.

    Of _Planetary-Calculations_,
    Of _Superstitious-Observations_,
    Of _Lots_, and _Dreames_, and _Accidents_,
    Which have but casuall events,
    Thou art so fond; and, unto such,
    Thou dost adhere, and trust so much,
    That, it succeedeth very well,
    No _Emblem_, now, to thee befell:
    Lest, these, which onely _Counsells_ bee,
    Might seeme firme _Destinies_ to thee.


52

    He that by drawing, here, his _Lot_,
    Some caveat or advice hath got,
    Did, peradventure, need alone
    That _Caution_, which he lighted on:
    But, unto thee, so needfull are
    All _Warnings_, and, all _Counsells_ here,
    That, _Fortune_ will not _one_ bestow,
    Lest, thou may’st thinke thou need’st no moe.


53

    You, may be glad, you drew not that,
    Which, in your thought, you guessed at;
    For, so it points out that _condition_,
    Whereof you give a great suspicion,
    That, had it such an _Emblem_ nam’d,
    As fits you right, you had beene sham’d.
    Since, then, your fault is unreveal’d,
    Amend, and keep it still conceal’d.


54

    The _Muses_ Oracle is dumbe,
    Because to tempt them you are come;
    For, in your _heart_, you much despise,
    To follow that, which they advise:
    Their admonitions, you doe jeere,
    And, scorne to helpe your _Wisedome_, here.
    The _Muses_, therefore, leave you, still,
    To be as foolish, as you will.


5

    It would, perhaps, have made thee proud,
    If, now, thy _Lot_ had beene allow’d
    To let an _Emblem_ shadow forth
    What is conceived of thy _worth_.
    Or, if thy _Vertues_ were descry’d,
    Perchance, thou wouldst be more envy’d
    Then praysed, when they are exprest;
    A _Blanke_ for thee, was therefore best.


6

    No _Emblem_, to this _Lot_, replyes;
    Minde, therefore, well (I thee advise)
    What from the _Preacher’s_ voice thou hear’st,
    When in the _Church_, thou next appear’st:
    Yea, there indeavour thou, to seeke
    Thy _Lot_ of _Counsell_, ev’ry weeke.
    For, at all seasons, there will bee
    Such _Prophecies_, concerning thee,
    That, if of those, thou takest heed,
    These _Emblems_, thou shalt never need.

                        TO THE MOST ILLVSTRIOVS
                Princesse, _FRANCIS_, Dutchesse Dowager
                  _of_ RICHMOND, _and_ LENNOX, _&c._


    Fame sayes (great PRINCESSE) that the _Pow’rs-above_,
    Will soone forgive; which, I desire to prove:
    For, I am guiltie of a _Venial-sinne_
    Against your GRACE; and, have remain’d therein
    Without an _Absolution_, so long time,
    That, now, my _Conscience_ checks me for the _Crime_;
    And, to reprove me for it, will not cease
    Till I have, someway, sought to make my _Peace_.
      To palliate my _Fault_, I could produce
    Enough, perhaps, to stand for an _Excuse_.
    But, when I mind what _Favours_, and what _Fame_
    I might have purchased unto my _Name_,
    (By taking Courage, to have done my best)
    I dare not make _Excuses_; but, request
    Your pardon, rather, and, that some _Oblation_
    May game my _Person_, future acceptation.
      To that intent, this humble _Offring_, here,
    Within your gracious presence, doth appeare.
    And, that it may the more content your eye,
    Well-graven _Figures_, help to beautifie
    My lowly _Gift_: And, vailed are in these,
    A _Treasury_ of Golden _Sentences_;
    By my well-meaning _Muse_, interpreted,
    That, with your NAME, their Morals may be spread
    And scattred, _Largesse-like_, (at your commanding)
    To helpe inrich the _Poore in Vnderstanding_.
      If YOV accept the _Tender_, I shall know,
    Your GRACE is pleased with your _Servant_, so,
    As, that there may be hope, my future Actions,
    Will give the more contenting Satisfactions:
    And, your _Encouragements_, my _Pow’rs_ may raise,
    To make the BEAVTIES of your _Later dayes_,
    More glorious, far, than your fresh YOVTH’S perfection,
    Though, knowne to be, the _Load-stone_ of _Affection_.
      For, like the loving TVRTLE, you have stood
    So constant, in your vowed _Widdow-hood_;
    So strictly, kept a solitarie state;
    So faithfull beene, to your deceased MATE;
    So firmly true, and truly kinde, to _them_,
    Which are the _Branches_ of his _Princely-stemme_;
    And, personated in so high a _Straine_,
    The parts of HONOVR; that, my rusticke _vaine_,
    Must raised be, before it can ascend
    To say, how much, your _Fame_, doth you commend.
      Yet, if these _Lines_, (or, _that_ they Vsher in)
    For me, some _Passage_ may, anew, begin
    To your _Esteeme_; I, may so happily,
    Illustrate forth, the _Golden-History_
    Of those _Affections_, which within your Brest,
    Have to the world remained unexprest.
    That, future times, to your applause may reade,

    My PEGASVS, had learn’d, e’re now, to rise,
    Which, yet, with lame, and sickly =Feathers= flies.
      But, HEE hath left us; and, I thought not on

    Nor could I dreame, till he did hence ascend,
    What t’was to want an =Honourable-friend=:
    Nor, what they feele, whom =Fate= constraines, to tarry
    On stormy Plaines, without a SANCTVARIE.
      Assoone, as from among us, he made wing,

    A =Mournfull-song=, not easie to forget;
    Because, I beare the =burthen= of it, yet.
    Nor was I silent (though my =Epicede=
    Appear’d not, for the publike eye to reade)
    But, griev’d in private, as one wanting =Art=,
    To give, the =Life of praise=, to his desart:
    Which, if I could have equall’d with his =Name=,
    His =Death= had gain’d my =Verse=, a =living-Fame=.
      And, why expresse I this? except it give
    Your GRACE, a fit occasion to perceive,
    That, my decayed =Hopes= I would renew,
    And, faine derive them downe, from HIM to YOV?

    Be =Lord=, in mee, of that, which was his right:
    And, for his Noble sake, vouchsafe to own
    A =Servant=, which, to you, is yet unknowne.
      As =Prologue=, to the service I intend,
    This PRESENT comes; and, without =Hope=, or =End=,
    Of gaining further =Grace=, or more =Esteeme=,
    Than may, with humblest modestie, beseeme

    Whose =Merits= have, no visible effect,
    Conducing to your profit; and, from whom
    The best of his intents, are yet to come.
      I cannot thinke, these =Lots=, or =Emblems=, are
    So worthy in themselves, as they’l appeare
    In your acceptance; Or, that they can give,
    Such Grace to YOV, as they’l from you receive.
    Yet, if YOV please, they may be, otherwhile,
    A profitable Meanes, to help beguile
    A Melancholy thought; And, have the pow’r
    To shorten (without losse) a tedious howre.
      Sometime (no doubt) content you are to walke
    In =Artlesse Groves=; Or, to admit the talke
    of Rustick =Swaines= (though ev’ry day you might
    Your self in well-trim’d =garden-bowr’s=, delight,
    Or, heare the learnedst =Muses=, when you please;)
    Ev’n so, for change, you may, perhaps, in these
    A =Recreation= finde; and, in some measure,
    A =Profit=, intermixed with your =Pleasure=.
      I will not make my =Promises= too large,
    Lest, my =Performances=, they overcharge
    With =Expectation=: but, I leave them, SIR,
    To =Bee=, and to =be thought=, the same they are.

    My =Willingnesse=, to =Ablenesse= advance:
    And, reap in =Mee= (when ripened they are grown)
    Some timely =fruits=, of that, which =you= have sown.
      Till then, let it suffice, that I professe
    A cheerefull, and a thankfull Readinesse

    That may be helpfull to attaine thereto:

    By scrambling up unto the dunghill-tops
    Of temp’rall _Riches_: and, of all the wayes,
    Most thinke this _course_ deserves the greatest _praise_.

    That, nothing Man possesseth outwardly
    Can purchase him the _Crowne_, that should be sought,
    Like _rightly-doing_, what is _rightly-taught_.

    The bruzing _Mace_ (although, perhaps, with us,

    This _Emblem’s_ Motto, chiefely poynteth at.
      In true _Divinity_, 'tis _God_ alone,

    _Hee_, onely, is that _ever-present-being_,

    Beholds, at one aspect, all things that _are_,
    That ever _shall be_, and that ever _were_.

    This _double-face_, that man to signifie,
    Who (whatsoere he undertakes to doe)
    Lookes, both _before_ him, and _behinde_ him, too.
    For, he shall never fruitfully forecast
    Affaires _to come_, who mindes not what is _past_:
    And, such as doe not, oft, _before_ them looke,
    May lose the labour, that’s already tooke.
    By, sometimes, looking _backward_, we behold
    Those things, which have been done in _times of old_;
    By looking wisely _forward_, we foresee
    Such matters, as in _future-times_ will bee:
    And, thus, we doe not onely fruits receive,

    The gifts of changing _Fortune_ doth implye:

    That, when by such like _Vertues_ Men are guided,
    Good _Fortune_ cannot be from them divided.

      By minutes, and by houres, the _Spring_ steales in,

    Vntill it brings the _Spring_ about againe,
    With all those _Resurrections_, which appeare,
    To wait upon her comming, every yeare.
      These _Roundells_, helpe to shew the _Mystery_

    From whence the CREATURE sprung, and, into _whom_
    It shall, againe, with full perfection come,

    I Should not care how hard my _Fortunes_ were,
    Might still my _Hopes_ be such, as now they are,
    Of helpes divine; nor feare, how poore I bee,
    If thoughts, yet, present, still may bide in mee.
    For, they have left assurance of such _ayd_,
    That, I am of no dangers, now afraid.
      Yea, now I see, mee thinkes, what weake and vaine
    _Supporters_ I have sought, to helpe sustaine
    My fainting heart; when some injurious hand,
    Would undermine the Station where I stand.
    Me thinks, I see how scurvie, and how base,
    It is to scrape for favours, and for grace,
    To men of earthly minds; and unto those,
    Who may, perhaps, before to morrow lose
    Their Wealth, (or their abus’d Authoritie)
    And, stand as much in want of helpe as I.
      Me thinks, in this _new-rapture_, I doe see
    The hand of _God_ from heaven supporting me,
    Without those _rotten-Ayds_, for which I whinde,
    When I was of my tother _vulgar-minde_:
    And, if in some one part of me it lay,
    I, now, could cut that _Limbe_ of mine away.
    Still, might I keepe this mind, there were enough
    _Within_ my selfe, (beside that cumbring stuffe
    Wee seeke _without_) which, husbanded aright,
    Would make mee _Rich_, in all the _Worlds_ despight.
    And, I have hopes, that, had shee quite bereft mee,
    Of those few _ragges_ and _toyes_, which, yet, are left me;

    This is that fruitfull _Plant_, which when it growes,
    Where wholesome _Water_ in abundance flowes,
    Was, by the _Psalmist_, thought a likely _Tree_,
    The _Emblem_, of a _blessed-man_, to bee:
    For, many wayes, it fitly typifies,
    The _Righteous-man_, with his proprieties;

      The _Palme_, (in this our _Emblem_, figur’d, thus)
    Depressed with a _Stone_, doth shew to us
    The pow’r of _Truth_: For, as this _Tree_ doth spread,
    And thrive the more, when weights presse downe the head;

    According as they make approaches to

    Yea, _Lord_, though _Sinners_ in high place doe sit,

    Themselves inferiours, unto those, to be,
    Whom, they did in their jollity, contemne,
    As blocks, or dunces, in respect of them.

    _She_ hath a _Comely-body_, to declare,
    How pleasing shee doth usually appeare
    To them, that love her Favours. She is _blinde_,
    (Or, hath still closed eyes) to put in minde,
    How blindly, and how heedlesly, she throwes
    Her _Largesse_, where her _Bounty_, she bestowes.
    She _stands upon a Ball_; that, wee may learne,
    Of outward things, the _tottering_, to discerne:
    Her _Ball_ hath _wings_; that it may signifie
    How apt her _Favours_ are, away to _flie_.
      A _Skarfe displayed by the wind_, she beares,
    (And, on her _naked-Body_, nothing weares)
    To shew, that what her _Favorite_ injoyes,
    Is not so much for _Vsefulnesse_, as _toyes_.
    Her _Head is hairelesse, all, except before_;
    To teach thee, that thy care should be the more
    To hold her _formost kindnesse_, alwayes fast;
    Lest, she doe show thee slipp’ry tricks, at last.
    And, lastly, that her _changing_ may be showne;
    She beareth in her Hand a _Wayned-moone_.
      By this Description, you may now descry
    Her true conditions, full as well as I:
    And, if you, still, suppose her, worth such honour,
    You have my leave to _wooe_, and _wayt_ upon her.
    Moreover (to her credit) I confesse,
    This _Motto_ falsly saith, her _Ficklenesse_
      Is like the _Moones_: For, she hath frown’d on mee
      Twelve _Moones_, at least; and, yet, no _Change_ I see.

    Whilst by the High-way-side, the _Flint-stone_ lies,
    Drie, cold, and hardnesse, are the properties
    We then perceive: But, when we prove it nigher,
    We finde, that, _Coldnesse_ doth inclose a _Fire_;
    And, that, though _Raine_, nor _cloudie-skie_ appeares,
    It will be (many times) bedew’d with _teares_.
      From hence, I mind, that many wronged are,
    By being judg’d, as they, at first, appeare;
    And, that, some should bee prais’d, whom wee despise,
    If _inward-Grace_, were seene with _outward-Eyes_.
    But, this is not that _Morall_ (wee confesse)
    Which this our _Emblem_, seemeth to expresse:
    For (if the _Motto_ speake the meaning right)
    It shewes, that, _hard-afflictions_ first must smite
    Our hardned hearts, before it will bee seene,
    That any _light_ of _Grace_, in them, hath beene.
    _Before the =Flint= will send forth shining Rayes,
    It must bee strucken, by the =Steele=, (it sayes.)_
      Another _Morall_, adde we may to this,
    (Which, to the _Figure_, sutes not much amisse.)
    The _Steele_, and _Flint_, may fitly represent
    _Hard-hearted men_, whose mindes will not relent:
    For, when in _opposition_, such become,
    The _fire_ of _Malice_, flames and sparkles from
    Their threatning Eyes; which else, close hidden rests,
    Within the closets of their flintie brests:
    And, flame out-right it will not, (though it smokes)

    Was chain’d so fast, that (if such _Dreames_ I had)
    My _thoughts_, and _longings_, are not now so mad.
    For, plaine I see, that, had my _Fortunes_ brought
    Such _Wealth_, at first, as my small _Wit_ hath sought;
    I might my selfe, and others, have undone,
    Instead of _Courses_, which I thought to runne.
    I finde my _Povertie_, for mee was fit;

    The _Flame_, which burn’d awhile, both cleere & strong,
    Becomes to be extinguished, ere long?
    This _Emblem_ gives the reason; for, it showes,
    That, when _Affection_, to perfection growes,
    The _Fire_, which doth inlighten, first, the same,
    Is made an _equall_, and a _mutuall-flame_.
      These burning _Torches_, are alike in _length_;

    Deserveth not the Title of a _Lover_;
    Or, else, was unrequited in Affection,

    For, _Love_, that loves, and is not lov’d as much,
    May perfect grow; but, yet, it is not such,
    Nor can be, till it may that _object_ have,
    Which _gives_ a _Heart_, for what it would _receive_:
    And, lookes not so much _outward_, as to heed
    What seemes _within_, to _want_, or to _exceed_.
    Whether our Emblem’s _Author_, thought of this,

    My _Light_ shall, one day, bee renew’d againe.
    Yea, though to some, I quite may seeme to lose
    My _Light_; because, my follies interpose
    Their shadowes to eclipse it: yet, I know,
    My _Crescents_, will increase, and _fuller_, grow.
      Assoone as in the _Flesh_, I beeing had,
    I mooved on in _Courses retrograde_,
    And, thereby lost my _Splendor_: but, I feele
    Soft motions, from that great _Eternall-Wheele_,
    Which mooveth all things, sweetly mooving mee,
    To gaine the _Place_, in which I ought to bee:
      And, when to _Him_, I backe _returne_, from _whom_
      At first I came, I shall at _Full_ become.

    Some write (but, on what grounds, I cannot tell)
    That they, who neere unto the _Deserts_ dwell,
    Where _Elephants_ are found, doe notice take,
    What trees they haunt, their sleeping-stocks to make;
    That, when they rest against an halfe-sawne stemme,
    It (falling) may betray those Beasts to them.
      Now, though the part _Historicall_, may erre,
    The _Morall_, which this _Emblem_ doth inferre,
    Is overtrue; and, seemeth to imply,
    The _World_ to bee so full of Treacherie,
    As, that, no corner of it, found can be,
    In which, from Falshoods Engines, wee are free.
      I have observ’d the _Citie_; and, I finde
    The _Citizens_, are civill, grave and kinde;
    Yet, many are deluded by their showes,
    And, cheated, when they trust in them repose.
    I have been oft at _Court_; where I have spent,
    Some idle time, to heare them _Complement_:
    But, I have seene in _Courtiers_, such deceit,
    That, for their Favours, I could never wait.
    I doe frequent the _Church_; and, I have heard
    Gods judgements, by the _Preachers_, there, declar’d,
    Against mens falshoods; and, I gladly heare
    Their zealous _Prayers_, and good _Counsells_ there;
    But, as I live, I finde some such as they,
    Will watch to doe a mischiefe, if they may.
    Nay, those poore sneaking _Clownes_, who seeke their living,
    As if they knew no manner of deceiving;
      Ev’n _those_, their _witts_, can (this way) so apply,
      That, they’l soone cousen, wiser men, than I.

    There is no Day, nor minute of the Day,
    In which, there are not many sent away
    From _Life_ to _Death_; or, many _drawing-on_,
    Which, must within a little while, bee gone.
    You, often, view the _Grave_; you, often, meet
    The _Buriers_, and the _Mourners_, in the street,
    Conveying of some Neighbour, to that home,
    Which must, e’re long, your _dwelling-place_ become.
    You see the _Race_, of many a youthfull _Sonne_
    Is finish’d, e’re his _Father’s_ Course is done;
    And, that, the hand of _Death_, regardeth neither
    Sexe, Youth, nor Age; but, mingleth all together.
    You, many times, in your owne houses, heare
    The groanes of _Death_, and, view your _Children_, there,
    Your loving _Parents_, or, beloved _Wives_,
    To gaspe for breath, and, labour for their _lives_.
      Nay, you your selves, do sometime find the paines
    Of _Sicknesse_, in your Bowels, and your Vaines.
    The _Harbingers_ of _Death_, sometime, begin
    To take up your whole _Bodie_, for their _Inne_.
    You beare their heavie _Aches_, on your back;
    You feele their _twinges_, make your heartstrings crack;
    And, sometime, lye imprison’d, and halfe dead,
    With _Age_, or with _Diseases_, on your bed:
    Yet you deferre your ends; and, still contrive,
    For temp’rall things; as if you thought to live
    Sixe _Ages_ longer: or, had quite forgot,
    That, you, and others, draw one _common-Lot_.
      But, that, you might not, still, the same forget,
      This _Emblem_, and this _Motto_, here were set.

THE THIRD LOTTERIE.


1

    The _Wreathes_ of GLORY, you affect,
    But, _meanes_ to gaine them, you neglect;
    And, (though in _doing_, you delight)
    You _doe_ not, alwayes, what is _right_:
    Nor are you growne, as yet, so wise,
    To know, to whom the richest _Prize_
    Doth appertaine; nor what it is.
    But, now, you are inform’d of _This_.

See, _Emblem_ I.


2

    Though you are _weake_, you much may doe,
    If you will set your _Wits_ thereto.
    For, meaner _Powres_, than you have had,
    And, meaner _Wits_, good shift have made,
    Both to contrive, and compasse that,
    Which abler men have wondred at.
    Your _Strength_, and _Wit_, unite, therefore,
    And, both shall grow improov’d the more.

See, _Emb._ II.


3

    Perhaps, thou mayst be one of them,
    Who, Civill _Magistrates_ contemne;
    And sleighteth, or else, flouteth at
    The _Ceremonies_ of Estate.
    That, thou maist, therefore, learne to get,
    Both better _Manners_, and more _Wit_,
    The _Sword_, and _Mace_, (by some despiz’d)
    Is, for thy sake, now _moralliz’d_.

See, _Emb._ III.


4

    By this thy _Lot_, wee may misdoubt,
    Thou look’st not warily about;
    But, hudlest onward, without heed,
    What went _before_, or may _succeed_;
    Procuring losse, or discontent,
    Which, _Circumspection_, might prevent.
    Therefore, with gratefulnesse, receive
    Those counsells, which our _Moralls_ give.

See, _Emb._ IV.


5

    Thou hast, unworthily, repin’d,
    Or, been displeased in thy mind,
    Because, thy _Fortunes_ doe not seeme
    To fit thy _Worth_ (in thy esteeme:)
    And loe, to check thy discontent,
    Thy _Lot_, a _Morall_, doth present;
    And shewes, that, if thou _vertuous_ bee,
    _Good-Fortune_, will attend on thee.

See, _Emb._ V.


6

    When thy Desires have good successe,
    Thine owne _Endeavors_, thou dost blesse;
    But, seldome unto _God_ thou giv’st
    Due thanks, for that, which thou receiv’st.
    Thine _Emblem_, therefore, tells from whom
    The fruits of good _Endeavours_, come:
    And, shewes (if thou to thrive intend)
    On whom, thou, alwayes, must depend.

See, _Emb._ VI.


7

    It may bee, thou art one of those,
    Whose _Faith_, more _bold_, than _fruitfull_ growes;
    And (building on some false _Decree_)
    Disheartnest those, that _Workers_ be
    To gaine (with _awfull-joy_) that _PriZe_,
    Which, unto no man, _God_ denies,
    That workes in _Hope_; and, lives by _Faith_.
    Marke, therefore, what thine _Emblem_ saith.

See, _Emb._ VII.


8

    Thou hast been willing, that thy _Name_,
    Should live the life of _Honest-Fame_;
    And, that, thy _labours_ (to thy praise)
    Continue might, in future dayes.
    Behold; the _Lot_, thou hapnest on,
    Hath showne, how this may well bee done.
    Pursue the _Course_, which there is taught,
    And, thy desires to passe are brought.

See, _Emb._ VIII.


9

    Thou, many things, hast well begun;
    But, little, to good purpose, done:
    Because, thou hast a fickle _braine_,
    And, _hands_ that love to take no paine.
    Therefore, it chanceth not amisse,
    That, thou hast such a _Chance_, as this:
    For, if thou want not _Grace_, or _Wit_,
    Thou maist, in time, have good of it.

See, _Emb._ IX.


10

    Whatev’r you seeme to others, now,
    It was the _Harrow_, and the _Plough_,
    By which, your _Predecessors_ got,
    The fairest portion of your _Lot_:
    And, (that, it may encrease your _Wit_)
    They haunt you, in an _Emblem_, yet.
    Peruse our _Morall_; and, perchance,
    Your _Profit_, it will much advance.

See, _Emb._ X.


11

    Much labour, and much time you spend,
    To get an able-constant _Friend_:
    But, you have ever sought him, there,
    Where, no such precious _Iewells_ are:
    For, you, _without_ have searching bin,
    To finde, what must be found _within_.
    This _Friend_, is mention’d by this _Lot_,
    But, _God_ knowes where he may be got.

See, _Emb._ XI.


12

    Thou seek’st for _Fame_; and, now art showne,
    For what, her _Trumpet_ shall be blowne.
    Thine _Emblem_, also, doth declare,
    What _Fame_ they get, who _vertuous_ are,
    For _Praise_ alone; and, what _Reward_,
    For such like _Studies_, is prepar’d.
    Peruse it; And, this _Counsell_ take;
    _Bee vertuous, for meere Vertues sake_.

See, _Emb._ XII


13

    This _Lot_, those persons, alwayes finds,
    That have high _thoughts_, and loftie _minds_;
    Or, such as have an itch to learne,
    That, which doth nothing them concerne;
    Or, love to peepe, with daring eyes,
    Into forbidden _Mysteries_.
    If any one of these thou bee,
    Thine _Emblem_, lessons hath for thee.

See, _Emb._ XIII.


14

    If all be true, these _Lots_ doe tell us,
    Thou shouldst be of those _Fidling-fellowes_,
    Who, better practised are growne,
    In _others_ matters, than their _owne_:
    Or, one, that covets to be thought,
    A man, that’s ignorant of nought.
    If it be so, thy _Morall_ showes
    Thy _Folly_, and what from it flowes.

See, _Emb._ XIV.


15

    Thou hast some _Charge_, (who e’re thou be)
    Which, _Tendance_ may expect from thee.
    And, well, perhaps, it may be fear’d,
    Tis often left, without regard:
    Or, that, thou dost securely sleep,
    When, thou should’st watch, more strictly, keep.
    Thou knowest best, if it be so:
    Take therefore heed, what is to doe.

See, _Emb._ XV.


16

    In secret, thou dost oft complaine,
    That, thou hast _hop’d_, and _wrought_ in vaine;
    And, think’st thy _Lot_, is farre more hard,
    Than what for others is prepar’d.
    An _Emblem_, therefore, thou hast got,
    To shew, it is our _common-Lot_,
    To _worke_ and _hope_; and, that, thou hast
    A _Blessing_ by it, at the last.

See, _Emb._ XVI.


17

    That thou hast _Honestie_, we grant;
    But, _Prudence_, thou dost often want:
    And, therefore, some have injur’d thee,
    Who farre more _Wise_, than _honest_ bee.
    That, now, _Discretion_ thou mayst add,
    To those _good-meanings_ thou hast had;
    The _Morall_ of thine _Emblem_, view;
    And, what it counsels, that, pursue.

See, _Emb._ XVII.


18

    To your _Long-home_, you nearer are,
    Than you (it may bee) are aware:
    Yea, and more easie is the _Way_,
    Than you, perchance, conceive it may.
    Lest, therefore, _Death_, should grim appeare,
    And, put you in a causelesse feare;
    (Or out of minding wholly passe)
    This _Chance_, to you allotted was.

See, _Emb._ XVIII.


19

    In slippery _Paths_, you are to goe;
    Yea, they are full of danger too:
    And, if you heedfull should not grow,
    They’l hazzard much, your overthrow.
    But, you the mischiefe may eschew,
    If wholsome Counsell, you pursue.
    Looke, therefore, what you may be taught,
    By that, which this your _chance_ hath brought.

See, _Emb._ XIX.


20

    This present _Lot_, concernes full neere,
    Not you alone, but all men here;
    For, all of us, too little heed
    His _love_, who for our sakes, did _bleed_.
    Tis true, that _meanes_, hee left behind him,
    Which better teacheth how to minde him:
    Yet, if wee both by _that_, and _this_,
    Remember him, 'tis not amisse.

See, _Emb._ XX.


21

    Tis hop’d, you just, and pious are,
    More out of _Conscience_, than for feare;
    And, that you’l vertuous courses take,
    For _Goodnesse_, and for _Vertue-sake_.
    Yet, since the best men, sometimes may
    Have need of helpes, in _Vertues_ way,
    Those usefull _Moralls_, sleight you not,
    Which are presented by this _Lot_.

See, _Emb._ XXI.


22

    This _Lot_ pertaineth unto those,
    (And who they bee, _God_ onely knowes)
    Who, to the world, have no desire;
    But, up to heav’nly things aspire.
    No doubt, but you, in some degree,
    Indow’d with such _affections_ bee;
    And, had this _Emblem_, that you might
    Encourag’d bee, in such a _Flight_.

See, _Emb._ XXII.


23

    The state of _Temp’rall_ things to shew,
    Yee have them, still, within your view;
    For, ev’ry object that wee see,
    An _Emblem_, of them, serves to bee.
    But, wee from few things, helps doe finde,
    To keepe _Eternitie_ in minde.
    This _Lot_, an _Emblem_ brings, therefore,
    To make you thinke upon it more.

See, _Emb._ XXIII.


24

    Vnlesse you better looke thereto,
    _Dis-use_, and _Sloth_, will you undoe.
    That, which of you despayred was,
    With ease, might have bin brought to passe;
    Had but so much bin done, as may
    Bee equall’d with _One Line a day_.
    Consider this; and, to that end,
    The _Morall_ of your _Lot_ attend.

See, _Emb._ XXIV.


_M_ 25

    If wee mistake not, thou art one,
    Who loves to court the _Rising-Sunne_;
    And, if this _Lot_, thy nature finde,
    Thou to _Preferment_ hast a minde:
    If so; learne hence, by whose respect
    (Next God) thou mayst thy hopes effect:
    Then, seeke to winn his grace to thee,
    Of what estate soe’re thou bee.

See, _Emb._ XXV.


26

    Thou to a _double-path_ art come;
    And, peradventure, troublesome,
    Thou findest it; for thee to know,
    On whether hand thou oughtst to goe.
    To put thee out of all suspect,
    Of _Courses_ that are indirect;
    Thy _Morall_ points thee to a path,
    Which _hardship_, but, no perill hath.

See, _Emb._ XXVI.


27

    You warned are of taking heede,
    That, never, you your _Bounds_ exceed;
    And, also, that you be not found,
    To come within your Neighbours _Bound_.
    There may be some concealed Cause,
    That, none but you, this _Emblem_ drawes.
    Examine it; And, If you see
    A fault, let it amended be.

See, _Emb._ XXVII.


28

    Your _Emblems_ morall doth declare,
    When, _Lovers_ fitly matched are;
    And, what the chiefest cause may be,
    Why, _Friends_ and _Lovers_ disagree.
    Perhaps, you somewhat thence may learne,
    Which your _Affection_ doth concerne.
    But, if it _Counsell_ you too late,
    Then, preach it at your _Neighbours_ gate.

See, _Emb._ XXVIII.

    Some, vrge their _Princes_ on to _Warre_,
    And weary of sweet _Peace_, they are.
    Some, seeke to make them, dote on _Peace_,
    (Till publike Danger more encrease)
    As if the World were kept in awe,
    By nothing else but preaching _Law_.
    Thy _Morall_ (if of those thou art)
    Doth act a _Moderators_ part.

See, _Emb._ XXIX.


30

    Tis feared, thou dost lesse esteeme,
    _Vpright_ to _bee_, than so to _seeme_;
    And, if thine actions, faire _appeare_,
    Thou carest not how foule they _are_.
    Though this bee not thy fault alone,
    Yet have a care of mending _One_:
    And, study thou, _Vpright_ to grow,
    As well in _Essence_, as in _Show_.

    Some, all their _time_, and _wealth_ have spent,
    In giving other men content;
    And, would not grudge to waste their _Blood_,
    To helpe advance the _Common-good_.
    To such as these, you have been thought,
    Not halfe so friendly as you ought.
    This _Lot_ therefore befalls, to shew,
    How great _respects_, to such, are due.

See, _Emb._ XXXI.


32

    You have been tempted (by your leave)
    In hope of _Lucre_, to deceive:
    But, much, as yet, you have not swerv’d
    From _Faith_, which ought to be observ’d.
    If well, hereafter, you would speed,
    In _dealing-honestly_, proceed:
    For, by your _Emblem_, you shall see,
    That, _Honest-men_, the _richest_ bee.

See, _Emb._ XXXII.


33

    We hope, no person, here, beleeves,
    That, you are of those wealthy _Theeves_,
    Who, _Chaines_ of gold, and pearle doe weare.
    And, of those _Theeves_, that, none you are,
    Which weares a _Rope_, wee, plainly see;
    For, you, as yet _unhanged_ bee:
    But, unto God, for _Mercie_ crie,
    Else _hang’d_ you may bee, e’re you die.

See, _Emb._ XXXIII.


34

    You, willing are, to put away,
    The thinking on your _latter-day_:
    You count the mention of it, _Folly_;
    A meanes of breeding _Melancholly_;
    And, newes unfit for men to heare,
    Before they come to _sixtie-yeare_.
    But, minde what Counsels now are sent,
    And, mend, lest you too late repent.

See, _Emb._ XXXIV.


35

    Your _Wits_, your _Wishes_, and your _Tongue_,
    Have run the _Wild goose-chase_, too long;
    And (lest all Reason, you exceed)
    Of _Rules_, and _Reines_, you now have need.
    A _Bridle_, therefore, and a _Square_,
    Prime _Figures_, in your _Emblem_, are.
    Observe their _Morall_, and I pray,
    Be _Wise_, and _Sober_, if you may.

See, _Emb._ XXXV.


36

    Because her _Ayd_ makes goodly showes,
    You, on the _World_, your trust repose;
    And, his _dependance_, you despise,
    Who, meerly, on _God’s_ helpe, relies.
    That, therefore, you may come to see,
    How pleas’d, and safe, those men may bee,
    Who have no ayd, but _God_, alone;
    This _Emblem_, you have lighted on.

See, _Emb._ XXXVI.


37

    Some, thinke your _Vertue_ very much;
    And, there is cause to thinke it such:
    For, many wayes it hath been tride;
    And, well the _Triall_ doth abide.
    Yet, think not, but some _brunts_ there are,
    Which, your owne _strength_ shall never beare.
    And, by the _Morall_ of your _Lot_,
    Learne, where, _Assistance_ may bee got.

See, _Emb._ XXXVII.


38

    Thou hast been grieved, and complain’d,
    Because, the _Truth_ hath wrong sustain’d.
    But, that, dismayd thou shouldst not be,
    Thine _Emblem_ will declare to thee,
    That, though the _Truth_ may suffer spite,
    It shall not bee depressed quite;
    But, by opposing, spread the more,
    And, grow more pow’rfull than before.

See, _Emb._ XXXVIII.


39

    By _Rashnesse_, thou hast often err’d,
    Or, else, thou hadst been more preferr’d.
    But, future errours, to prevent,
    Thou to the slow-pac’d _Oxe_ art sent,
    To learne more _Staydnesse_; and, to doe
    Thy _Workes_, with _Perseverance_, too.
    Hee that this creatures _Vertue_ scornes,
    May want it all, except his _Hornes_.

See, _Emb._ XXXIX.

    Dame _Fortunes_ favour seemes to bee
    Much lov’d, and longed for, of thee;
    As if, in what, her hand bestowes,
    Thou mightst thy confidence repose.
    But, that, her _manners_ may bee knowne,
    This _Chance_, upon thee, was bestowne.
    Consider well, what thou hast got,
    And, on her flattrings, dote thou not.

See, _Emb._ XL.


41

    The _Steele_ and _Flint_, declare, in part,
    The Temper of a _Stony-heart_;
    And, shewe, that thence, no _Vertue_ flowes,
    Till it be forced out, with blowes.
    Some other, _Moralls_ thou maist learne,
    Thereby, which will thy _good_, concerne:
    Marke, therefore, what they doe declare,
    And, minde it, as occasions are.

See, _Emb._ XLI.


42

    Thou thinkst thy _Witt_, had made thee great,
    Had _Povertie_ not beene some _let_:
    But, had thy _Wealth_ as ample beene,
    As, thou thy _Witt_, didst overweene;
    Insteed of thy desired _Height_,
    Perhaps, thou hadst beene ruin’d quite.
    Hereafter, therefore, be content,
    With whatsoever _God_ hath sent.

See, _Emb._ XLII.


43

    To _Discord_, thou art somewhat prone,
    And, thinkst thou mayst subsist alone;
    Regarding not how safe they bide,
    Who, fast, in _Concords_ bands are tide.
    But, that thou mayst the better heed,
    What _Good_, from _Vnion_ doth proceed,
    An _Emblem_ is become thy _Lot_,
    From which, good _Caveats_ may be got.

See, _Emb._ XLIII.


44

    Thou wouldst be lov’d; and, to that end,
    Thou dost both _Time_, and _Labour_ spend:
    But, thou expect’st (as wee beleeve)
    More _Love_, than thou dost meane to give.
    If so thou then, art much to blame:
    For, _Love_ affects a _muturall-flame_;
    Which, if it faile on either side,
    Will never, long time, true abide.

See, _Emb._ XLIV.


45

    If all your _pow’rs_, you should unite,
    Prevaile in your Desires, you might:
    And, sooner should effect your ends,
    If you should muster up your _Friends_.
    But, since your _Genius_ doth suspect,
    That, you such _Policie_ neglect,
    Your _Lot_ presenteth to your view
    An _Emblem_, which instructeth you.

See, _Emb._ XLV.


46

    Because, thou mayst be one of them,
    Who dare the deeds of _Kings_ condemne;
    (As if such eyes as theirs and yours
    Could view the depth of _Sov’raigne pow’rs_;
    Or, see, how in each _Time_, and _Place_,
    _God_ rules their hearts, in ev’ry case.)
    To check thy sawcinesse, in this,
    An _Emblem_ comes not much amisse.

See, _Emb._ XLVI.


47

    Of many goodly parts thou vauntst;
    And, much thou hast, though much thou wantst:
    But, well it were, that, lesse, thou hadst,
    Vnlesse more use thereof thou mad’st.
    That, therefore, thou mightst come to see,
    How vaine _unpractiz’d-vertues_ bee,
    Peruse thine _Emblem_; and, from thence,
    Take usefull heed of thy _Offence_.

See, _Emb._ XLVII.


48

    By this thy _Lot_, it may appeare,
    Decayd thy _Hopes_, or _Fortunes_ are.
    But, that, thou mayst no courage lose,
    Thine _Emblem_, by example, showes,
    That, as the _Moone_ doth from the _Waine_
    Returne, and fill her _Orbe_ againe:
    So, thou thy _Fortunes_ mayst renew,
    If, honest _Hopes_, thou shalt pursue.

See, _Emb._ XLVIII.


49

    Some _Foes_, for thee, doe lie in wait,
    Where thou suspectest no _Deceit_;
    Yea, many a one, thy harme intends,
    Whom thou dost hope will be thy _Friends_:
    Be, therefore, heedfull, whom to _trust_;
    What _walke_ thou tak’st, and what thou _dost_;
    For, by thine _Emblem_, thou shalt see,
    That, _warinesse_, will needfull bee.

See, _Emb._ XLIX.


50

    It seemes, by drawing of this _Lot_,
    The day of _Death_, is much forgot;
    And, that, thou needst a faithfull _Friend_,
    To minde thee of thy _latter-end_.
    Vnheeded, therefore, passe not by,
    What now thine _Emblem_ doth imply;
    So, thou shalt heare (without affright)
    _Death’s_ message, though it were to night.

See, _Emb._ L.


51

    Thou seek’st by fickle _Chance_, to gaine,
    What thou by _Vertue_ might’st attaine.
    Endeavour well, and, nothing shall
    To thee, unfortunately fall:
    For, ev’ry variable _Chance_,
    Thy firme contentment, shall advance.
    But, if thou, yet, remaine in doubt,
    Turne _Fortunes-wheele_, once more, about.


52

    Thy _Lot_, no Answere will bestow,
    To that, which thou desir’st to know;
    Nor canst thou, here, an _Emblem_ find,
    Which to thy purpose is inclinde.
    Perhaps, it is too late to crave,
    What thou desirest, now, to have:
    Or, but in vaine, to mention that,
    Which thy _Ambition_ aymeth at.
    Then, take it not in evill part,
    That, with a _Blanck_, thou answer’d art.


53

    Although you now refused not,
    To trie the _Fortune_ of your _Lot_;
    Yet, you, perhaps, unwilling are,
    This company the same should heare,
    Lest, some harsh _Morall_ should unfold
    Such tricks, as you could wish untold.
    But, loe, you need not stand in awe;
    For, 'tis a _Blanck_, which now you draw.


54

    It proves a _Blanck_; for, to what end,
    Should wee a serious _Morall_ spend,
    Where, _teachings_, _warnings_, and _advise_,
    Esteemed are of little price?
    Your onely purpose, is to looke
    Upon the _Pictures_ of this _Booke_;
    When, more discretion you have got,
    An _Emblem_ shall attend your _Lot_.


55

    You might have drawne an _Emblem_, here,
    In which your _manners_ pictur’d were:
    But, some will vexe, when they shall see
    Themselves, so painted out to bee,
    And, blame this _Booke_, as if it had
    By some unlawfull _Art_ been made:
    (Or, was contriv’d, that, to their shame,
    Men, on themselves, might _Libels_ frame)
    And, lest you may bee so unwise,
    Your _Lot_, an _Emblem_, now, denies.


56

    Because, _Good Chances_, others drew,
    To trie these _Lots_, it pleased you.
    But, had you such an _Emblem_ found,
    As fits you rightly, you had froun’d;
    Or, _inwardly_, you would have _chast_,
    Although you _outwardly_ had laugh’d.
    You, therefore, very glad may bee,
    This proves a _Blanck_; and, so may wee.

                         THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE=
                  PHILLIP, _Earle of_ PEMBROOKE, and
             MOVNTGOMERIE, &c. Lord =Chamberlaine= of the
          Houshould, =Knight= of the most honourable Order of
       the =Garter=, and one of his =Majesties= most Honourable
                          =Privie-Councell=._


_My Honourable_ LORD,

    Though, _Worthlesse_ in my owne repute I am;
    And, (though my _Fortune_, so obscures my Name
    Beneath my _Hopes_; that, now, it makes me seeme
    As little worth, in other mens esteeme,
    As in mine owne;) yet, when my _Merits_ were
    No better, than, to most, they now appeare,
    It pleased some, ev’n some of those that had
    The _Noblest Names_, (and, those of whom was made
    The best Account) so lowly to descend,
    As, my well-meaning _Studies_, to befriend.
      Among those WORTHIES, I may both bemone
    (My selfe in HIM) and memorize, for _One_,
    Your much renowned BROTHER, as a _Chiefe_
    In bringing to my waned _Hopes_, reliefe;
    And, in my _Faculties_, were I as able
    To honour _Him_, as he was honourable,
    I would have showne, how, all this _Emperie_
    Hath lost a _Friend_, in HIM, as much as I.
      To MEE, so freely, of his owne accord
    It pleased HIM, his _Favours_, to afford;
    That, when our learned, and late _Sov’raigne-Prince_,
    (By others mis-informed) tooke offence
    At my Free _Lines_; HEE, foun’d such _Meanes_ and _Place_
    To bring, and reconcile mee to his _Grace_;
    That, therewithall, his _Majestie_ bestow’d
    A Gift upon mee, which his _Bountie_ show’d:
    And, had inrich’d mee; if, what was intended,
    Had not, by othersome, beene ill befriended.
      But, as I long time, suffred have by those
    Who labour’d much, my thrivings, to oppose:
    So, _I my selfe_, (although not out of pride,
    As many thinke it) have so much relide
    Vpon the _Royall-Gift_, neglecting so
    To fortifie the same, as others do
    By making Friends; that my estate grew lesse
    (By more than twice five hundred Marks decrease)
    Through that, which for, my profit was bestowne.
    And, I, ere this, had wholly been undone;
    But, that the _Wealth_, which I relie on, most,
    Consists in things, which never can be lost.
      Yet, by his _Losse_, I have _Occasions_ had
    To feele, why other men are often sad.
    And, I, (who blushed, to be troublesome
    To any Friend) therby, almost am come
    To such a passe; that, what I wish to have,
    I should grow impudent enough to _Crave_,
    Had not impartiall _Death_, and wasting _Time_,
    Of all my Friends quite worne away the _Prime_;
    And, left mee none, to whom I dare present
    The meanest suite without encouragement:
    Although, the greatest _Boone_, I would implore,
    Should cost them, but a _Word_, or little more.
    Yet, some there are, no doubt, for whose respect
    I might endeavour, with no vaine effect;
    Had I but cause, to have as high esteeme,
    Of mine owne _Merits_, as I have of them.
    And, if your _Honour_ should be so inclin’d,
    As I desire; I, now am sure to finde
    Another _Pembrooke_, by whose ayde sustain’d,
    I may preserve, what by the _Last_ I gain’d.
      To make adventure, how it will succeed,
    I now am come. And lo, my LORD, insteed
    Of better _Advocates_, I first begin,
    Mine EMBLEMS, by these _Lines_, to Vsher in;
    That, _they_, by these admittance may effect
    For _Mee_, and for _themselves_, your kinde respect.
      That, which in _them_, best Worthy you shall find,
    Is this; that, they are Symptomes of a _Minde_,
    Affecting honestie: and of a _Heart_,
    So truly honouring a true desert,
    That, I am hopefull made, they will acquire
    As much respect as I can well desire:
    And, SIR, your _Candor_, your knowne _Courtesies_,
    With other praisefull _Vertues_, make mee rise
    To this Beliefe; that, YOV by fav’ring mee
    Hereafter, may as highly honour’d be,
    As by some former Bounties; and encrease
    My Future _Merit_, by your _Worthinesse_.
      However, what I _am_ or shall be knowne
    To _Bee_, by _Your Deservings_, or mine _owne_,
    You may command it; and, be sure to finde
    (Though false my _Fortunes_ prove) a Faithfull _Mind_.

_Thus, unfainedly, professeth_

      _Your Honours_

              _truest Honourer_,

              GEO: WITHER.

                  most Honourable= Privie Counsell._

_Right Noble SIR_,

    _Having, of late, some =Cause=, to overlooke
    That thankfull =Register=, wherein I booke
    My noblest =Friends=; I found so many =Names=
    Possessing nothing, but their honour’d =Fames=,
    (Whose =living Persons=, wee injoyed, here,
    A while agoe;) that, I began to feare,
    I might grow =Friendlesse=; (having now so few)
    Vnlesse I sought, their =Number= to renew._
      _By some =Disasters=, also, gaining proofe,
    How much this =Course= would make for my behoofe;
    I call’d my =Wits= to =Counsell=, =Where=, and HOW
    I might, with hopefulnesse, begin to sow
    The seeds of such =a Blessing=: And, me thought
    =Within mee=, something said: =Where should be sought
    What thou so gladly wouldst renewed finde,
    But, from some BRANCHES of the selfe-same kinde;
    Whose faire Aspects may seeme to promise fruit,
    According to the Virtues of the= Roote?_
      _Assoone as Fancie had inform’d me so,
    Your =Lordship=, came to my remembrance, too,
    With what our =Soveraigne’s= Favour, =Vulgar Fame=,
    Or, your owne =Merits=, addeth to your =Name=.
    Which, having weigh’d, no doubts at all I had
    Of =Worth= in =Yov=; But, rather, doubtings made
    That, all my =Wits= would insufficient be,
    To make that =Worth=, become a =Friend= to mee.
    For, I have oft observ’d, that, =Favour= shunnes
    The best =Desert=, if after =her=, it runnes._
      _Yet_, who can tell what may befall? thought I:
    It is no great _Adventure_, if I try
    Without successe: And, if, I gaine my _End_,
    I am assured of a _Noble-Friend_.
    His honourable FATHER, deem’d mee worth
    So much respecting as to seeke me forth,
    When, I was more _obscure_: And, MEE, for nought
    But, onely to _Befriend mee_, forth HEE sought.
    Then, wherefore, of his SONNE, should I suspect
    That (feeling =Him=) hee can my love reject?
    Since, _Courtesie_ doth alwaies, there, abound,
    Where such a lovely _Personage_ is found?
      _My LORD, these were my =Fancies=: But I take them
    To be of no more worth, than, you shall make them
    By your =Acceptance=: Nor, is’t my intent
    To Court you, with fruitlesse =Complement=:
    But, to attempt your =Favour= with a mind,
    As readily, and really, inclinde
    To =serve= you, when my services may steed;
    As to expect your Favours, in my need.
    For, had my =Fates= enabled me so much,
    I should more willingly have sought out such
    On whom I Courtesies might have bestowne,
    Than, seeke to cure =Misfortunes= of mine =owne=.
      No doubt, but, every day, your =Lordship= heares
    =Inventions=, which may better please your eares
    Than these I now present; And, yet you might
    (For ought I knew) finde profit, or delight,
    By our plaine EMBLEMS, or, some =uses= in them,
    Which from your =Honour=, some respects may win them;
    Ev’n for that good =Moralitie=, which they
    To Vulgar Vnderstandings will convay.
      But, Truth to speake, the chiefest cause which drew
    My minde, to make them PRESENTS, for your view,
    Was, but to take =Occasion= to professe,
    That, I am =Servant=, to your WORTHINESSE.
    In which, if YOV are pleased; All is got,
    At which I aym’d: And, though you like it not,
    It shall but teach Mee (for the time to come)
    To take more heed, where I am troublesome._

And, I shall be, neverthelesse,

      your Honours to be commanded,

              as becommeth your Servant,

              GEO: WITHER.

    I will no meaner =Light= pursue._

    When, with a serious musing, I behold
    The gratefull, and obsequious _Marigold_,
    How duely, ev’ry morning, she displayes
    Her open brest, when _Titan_ spreads his Rayes;
    How she observes him in his daily walke,
    Still bending towards him, her tender stalke;
    How, when he downe declines, she droopes and mournes,
    Bedew’d (as 'twere) with teares, till he returnes;
    And, how she vailes her _Flow’rs_, when he is gone,
    As if she scorned to be looked on
    By an inferiour _Eye_; or, did contemne
    To wayt upon a meaner _Light_, then _Him_.
    When this I meditate, me-thinkes, the _Flowers_
    Have _spirits_, farre more generous, then ours;
    And, give us faire Examples, to despise
    The servile Fawnings, and Idolatries,
    Wherewith, we court these earthly things below,
    Which merit not the service we bestow.
      But, oh my God! though groveling I appeare
    Vpon the Ground, (and have a rooting here,
    Which hales me downward) yet in my desire,
    To that, which is above mee, I aspire:
    And, all my best _Affections_ I professe
    To _Him_, that is the _Sunne of Righteousnesse_.
    Oh! keepe the _Morning_ of his _Incarnation_,
    The burning _Noone-tide_ of his bitter _Passion_,
    The _Night_ of his _Descending_, and the _Height_
    Of his _Ascension_, ever in my sight:
      That imitating him, in what I may,
      I never follow an inferiour _Way_.

    Long since, the sacred _Hebrew Lyrick_ sayd,
    (A Truth, which never justly was denayd)
    That, _All the world is God’s_; and that his _hands_
    Enclose the limits of the farthest _Lands_.
    The selfe same _Truth_ affirmes, that likewise, there,
    By him, their _clodds_, and _furrowes_ warred are,
    And, that with _dewes_ and _showres_, he doth so blesse
    The dwellings of the barren _Wildernesse_,
    That, those Inhabitants (whom some conceiv’d,
    Of usefull, and all pleasant things bereav’d)
    Their labors, with advantage, doe employ,
    And, fetch their yearely _Harvests_ home, with joy.
      Why then should wee, that in God’s _Vineyard_ live,
    Distrust that all things needfull hee will give?
    Why should his _Garden_ doubt of what it needs,
    Since hee oft waters barren _Rocks_ and _Weeds_?
    Why should his _Children_, live in slavish feare,
    Since hee is kind to those that strangers are?
    Or, whither from his presence, can we flie,
    To whom the furthest _hiding-place_ is nigh.
      And, if I may, from lower objects clime,
    (To questioning, in matters more sublime)
    Why should I thinke, the _Soule_ shall not bee fed,
    Where God affoords, to _Flesh_, her _daily Bread_?
    Or, dreame, that hee, for some, provided none,
    Because, on us, much _Mercie_ is bestowne?
    'Tis true enough, that _Hell_ devoureth all,
    Who shall be found without the _Churches_ pale;
      But, how farre that extends, no Eye can see,
      Since, _in Gods hands, Earth’s farthest Corners bee_.

    The World is much for _Shewes_, and few there are
    So diligent to _bee_, as to _appeare_;
    Although a little travaile more, would make them
    Those men, for which, the _lookers-on_ mistake them.
    Some, have so toyled, and consum’d so much,
    To get a false repute of being _Rich_,
    That, they have spent farre more, than would have bought,
    The _substance_ of the _shadow_, they have sought;
    And, caused those, who deem’d them rich before,
    To know them, to bee miserably _poore_.
      Some others, would so faine be counted _Wise_,
    That, they consume in _Curiosities_,
    In _Sophistries_, and superficiall _showes_,
    More pretious Time, than would have made them those,
    They long to seeme, (had halfe that meanes been spent,
    In seeking _Wisdome_, with a pure intent)
    Whereas, the glorioust purchases of such,
    (Though by their Peeres they seeme applauded much)
    Are still so vaine, that little they possesse,
    But fruitlesse _leaves_, of _learned foolishnesse_:
    Yea, by affecting more than is their due,
    They lose ev’n both the _substance_, and the _shew_;
    And, so, instead of honours _Crowne_, have worne
    The _Coxcombes_, of a well-deserved scorne.
      But, of all _Fooleries_, the grossest _Folly_
    Is theirs, who weare those _garbes_ of _seeming-holy_,
    Which paine them sore, yet make them still appeare,
    To _God_ and _Men_, as wicked as they are.
      Be, therefore, what, to be thou hast profest;

    To lose the gemme, which most they seeke to gaine.

    Marke well this _Emblem_; and, (when in a _thread_,
    You see the _Globe_, there, hang above their head,
    Who in securitie, beneath it sit)
    Observe likewise, the _Knife_, that threatens it;
    The smallnesse of the _Twine_; and, what a death
    Would follow, should it fall on those beneath:
    And (having well observ’d it) mind, I pray,
    That, which the word about it, there, doth say:
    For, it includes a _Caveat_, which wee need
    To entertaine, with a continuall heed.
      Though few consider it, wee finde it thus
    (Throughout our lives) with ev’ry one of us.
    _Destruction_ hangeth in a _single thread_,
    Directly over every _Sinner’s_ head.
    That _Sentence_ is gone forth, by which wee stand
    Condemn’d to suffer death. The dreadfull hand,
    Of God’s impartiall _Iustice_, holds a _Knife_,
    Still ready, to cut off our _thread of life_;
    And, 'tis his _mercie_, that keepes up the _Ball_
    From falling, to the ruine of us all.
      Oh! let us minde, how often wee have bin,
    Ev’n in the very act of _Deadly-sinne_,
    Whilst this hung over us; and, let us praise,
    And love him, who hath yet prolong’d our dayes:
    Yea, let our thankfulnesse, bring forth such fruit,
    As, to the benefit may somewhat suit:
    For, though a _sudden-Death_ may not ensue,
    Yet, (since _Times_ Axe, doth every minute hew
      The _Root of Life_) the Tree, e’re long, must fall;
      And, then perhaps, too late, repent wee shall.

    Behind thee dost thou looke, when thou dost fly?
    As if thou seem’dst in thy swift flight, to heare
    Those _dangers_ following thee, w^{ch} thou dost feare?
    Alas! thou labour’st, and thou runn’st in vaine,
    To shunne, by _flight_, thy _terrors_, or thy _paine_;
    For, loe, thy _Death_, which thou hast dreaded so,
    Clings fast unto thee, wheresoere thou goe:
    And while thou toyl’st, an _outward-ease_ to win,
    Thou draw’st thine owne _destruction_ further _in_;
    Making that _Arrow_, which but prickes thy hide,
    To pierce thy tender entrailes, through thy side.
      And, well I may this wounded _Hart_ bemoane;
    For, here, me thinkes, I’m taught to looke upon
    Mine owne condition; and, in him, to see
    Those deadly wounds, my _Sinnes_ have made in mee.
    I greatly feare the _World_, may unawares
    Intangle mee, by her alluring snares:

    Some poys’nous fume, my _Spirit_ to infect,
    With ghostly _Pestilence_; and, I assay,
    To flie from these, with all the pow’rs I may.
    But, oh my Flesh! this very _Flesh_ I weare,
    Is worse to mee, than _Worlds_, and _Devils_ are:
    For, without this, no pow’r on mee, they had.
    This is that _Shirt_, which made _Alcides_ mad.
    It is a _griefe_, which I shall never cure,
    Nor flie from, whilst my life-time doth endure:
      From thence, oh _Lord_, my greatest _sorrowes_ bee;

    And sport his wofull _Pris’ners_ lives away;
    More torturing them, 'twixt fruitlesse _hopes_ and _feares_,
    Than when their bowels, with his teeth he teares:
    For, by much terrour, and much crueltie,
    Hee kills them, ten times over, e’re they die.

    The best men wish their powre might be restrain’d:
    But, they who shun enormities, through _Feare_,
    Are glad when _good-men_ out of Office are.

    Perhaps intending, thereby, to expresse,
    A sorrow for his wilde _Ambitiousnesse_;

      However, let it serve us, to declare,
    How vaine their toylings, and ambitions are,
    Who rob themselves, and other men of rest,

    Before those _hopes_ begin to spring and spread?
    Have therefore they that hate me, cause to boast,

    _Him_, whom that _Rod_, most rightly typifies,

    From these well-order’d _Arrowes_, and the _Snake_,

    That, where an able _Prudence_, doth combine
    _Vnited-forces_, by good _Discipline_,
    It maketh up a pow’r, exempted from
    The feare, or perill, to be _overcome_:

      For, doubtlesse, neither is it in the force,
    Of iron _Charets_, or of armed _Horse_,
    In which, the _King_, securitie may finde,

    In warlike _Postures_; nor in theirs, who drill

    According as _Occasion_ makes the _Fight_.
    But, men must use a further _Prudence_ too,
    Or else, those _vulgar-Arts_ will all undoe.
    For, these, are onely _Sciences_ injoynd,
    To order well the _Body_, not the _Mind_:
    And, men best train’d in these (oft times) we see,

    A _Foole_, sent forth to fetch the _Goslings_ home,
    When they unto a Rivers brinck were come,
    (Through which their passage lay) conceiv’d a feare
    His Dames best _Brood_, might have been drowned there;
    Which, to avoyd, hee thus did shew his wit,
    And his good nature, in preventing it.
    Hee, underneath his _girdle_, thrusts their heads,
    And, then the Coxcombe through the water wades.
      Here learne, that when a _Foole_ his helpe intends,
    It rather doth a mischiefe, then befriends;
    And, thinke, if there be danger in his _love_,
    How harmefull his _Maliciousnesse_ may prove:
    For, from his _kindenesse_, though no profit rise
    To doe thee spight, his _Malice_ may suffise.
    I could not from a _Prince_ beseech a boone
    By suing to his _Iester_ or _Buffoone_:
    Nor, any Fooles vaine humor, sooth or serve,
    To get my bread, though I were like to starve.
    For, to be _poore_, I should not blush so much,
    As if a _Foole_ should raise me to be _rich_.
      Lord, though of such a kinde my faults may be,
    That sharpe _Affliction_ still must tutor mee,
    (And give me due _Correction_ in her Schooles)
    Yet, oh preserve me from the scorne of _Fooles_.
    Those wicked _Fooles_, that in their hearts have sed
    There is no God; and, rather give me _Bread_
    By _Ravens_, LORD, or in a _Lions_ Den,
    Then by the Favours of such foolish men:
      Lest, if their _dainties_ I should swallow downe,
      Their smile might more undoe, me, than their _frowne_.

    Although there bee no Timber in the _Vine_,
    Nor strength to raise the climbing _Ivie-twine_,
    Yet, when they have a helper by their side,
    Or, prop to stay them, like this _Pyramide_,
    One roote sometime, so many _Sprayes_ will beare,
    That, you might thinke, some goodly _Grove_ it were:
    Their tender stalkes, to climbe aloft, are seene;
    Their boughs are cover’d with a pleasant greene;
    And, that, which else, had crept upon the ground,
    Hath tops of loftie trees, and turrets crown’d.
      This _Emblem_, fitly shadowes out the Natures
    Of us, that are the _Reasonable-creatures_:
    For, wee are truely by our _nat’rall-birth_,
    Like _Vines_ undrest, and creeping on the earth;
    Nor free from spoyling, nor in case to beare
    Good _fruits_, or _leaves_, while we are groveling there.
    But, if _new-borne_ by _Grace_, streight borne are wee,
    From earthly creepings, by that _Living-tree_,
    Which, here, was planted, meerely to this end,
    That, by his _pow’r_, our _weaknesse_ might ascend.
    And, hee our _frailtie_ to himselfe so takes,
    So, of his _might_, the partners us hee makes;
    That, hee, in us, doth seeme to hide his _pow’rs_,
    And, make the _strength_ hee gives, appeare as ours.
      Continue, _Lord_, this _Grace_, and grant wee may,
    Firme hold, on our _Supporter_, alwayes lay:
    So climbing, that wee nor neglect, nor hide
    His _Love_; nor over-climbe it, by our _Pride_.
      Thus, our yet staggering _weaknesse_, shall at length,
      Bee fully changed into perfect _Strength_.

    Good Folkes, take heede; for, here’s a wanton _Wagge_,
    Who, having _Bowes_ and _Arrowes_, makes his bragg
    That, he hath some unhappy trick to play;
    And, vowes to shoot at all he meets to day.
    Pray be not carelesse; for, the _Boy_ is blinde,
    And, sometimes strikes, where most he seemeth kinde.
    This rambling _Archer_ spares nor one, nor other:
    Yea, otherwhile, the _Monkey_ shoots his Mother.
      Though you be little _Children_, come not neere;
    For, I remember (though’t be many a yeare
    Now gone and past,) that, when I was a _Lad_,
    My Heart, a pricke, by this young Wanton had,
    That, pain’d me seven yeares after: nor had I
    The grace (thus warn’d) to scape his waggery;
    But many times, ev’n since I was a man,
    He shot me, oftner then I tell you can:
    And, if I had not bene the stronger-hearted,
    I, for my over-daring, might have smarted.
      You laugh now, as if this were nothing so;
    But, if you meet this _Blinkard_ with his Bow,
    You may, unlesse you take the better care,
    Receive a _wound_, before you be aware.
    I feare him not; for, I have learned how
    To keepe my heart-strings from his Arrowes now:
    And, so might you, and so might ev’ry one
    That vaine _Occasions_, truely seekes to shunn.
    But, if you sleight my Counsells, you may chance
    To blame at last, your willfull ignorance:
      For, some, who thought, at first, his wounds but small
      Have dyed by them, in an _Hospitall_.

    Whose resolutions nothing alter can.
    For, as the _Cube_, which way soever plac’t,
    Stands ever in one _posture_, firmely fast,

    Nor, being any other than he seemes.
      Although by Nature, wee are wondrous hard,

    Looke well, I pray, upon this _Beldame_, here,
    For, in her _habit_, though shee gay appeare,
    You, through her youthfull _vizard_, may espy
    Shee’s of an old _Edition_, by her _Eye_:
    And, by her wainscot face, it may bee seene,
    Shee might your _Grandams_ first _dry nurse_ have been.
      This is an _Emblem_, fitly shaddowing those,
    Who making faire, and honest outward showes,
    Are inwardly deform’d; and, nothing such,
    As they to bee suppos’d, have strived much.
    They chuse their _words_, and play well-acted _parts_,
    But, hide most loathsome projects in their hearts;
    And, when you think sweet _Friendship_ to embrace,
    Some ugly _Treason_, meets you in the face.
    I hate a painted _Brow_; I much dislike
    A Mayden-blush, dawb’d on a furrowed _Cheeke_:
    And, I abhorre to see old _Wantons_ play,
    And, suite themselves, like _Ladies of the May_.
    But, more (yea, most of all) my soule despiseth
    A _Heart_, that in _Religious formes_, disguiseth
    Prophane intentions; and arrayes in white,
    The coale-blacke conscience of an _Hypocrite_.
    Take heed of such as these; and, (if you may)
    Before you trust them, tract them in their way.
    Observe their footsteps, in their private _path_:
    For, these (as 'tis beleev’d, the _Devill_ hath)
    Have _cloven feet_; that is, _two wayes_ they goe;
    One for their _ends_, and tother for a _show_.

    A _Heart_ with _Hand-in-hand_, united thus,
    Makes here an _Emblem_ not unknowne to us;
    And, 'tis not hard for any Vulgar wit,
    Without a _Comment_, to interpret it.
    But, though of ev’ry man confest it be,
    That _Hand_ and _Heart_ together should agree;
    And, that, what we in _outward-shew_ expresse,
    Perform’d should be, with _inward-heartinesse_.
    (Since, now the World, to such a passe is growne,
    That, all is not consider’d, which is knowne)
    I cannot thinke it altogether vaine,
    To speake of that, which may appeare so plaine.
      When thou dost reach thy _hand_ unto thy friend,
    Take order, that thy _heart_ the same intend:
    For, otherwise in _Hand_, or _Heart_, thou lyest,
    And, cuttest off a _Member_, e’re thou dyest.
    Some, give their _Hearts_ (as many _Lovers_ do)
    Yet, are afraid, to set their _hands_ thereto.
    Some give their _Hands_; and, then by many a deed,
    To ratifie the _gift_, they dare proceede;
    Yet, keep their _tongues_ from saying what they meant,
    To helpe excuse their _hearts_, when they repent.
    Yea, some can very cunningly expresse,
    In outward shew, a winning heartinesse,
    And, steale the deare _affections_ they have sought,
    From those, to whom they meant, nor promis’d ought.
    Then, will they, if _advantage_ come thereby,
    Make all their _Deeds_, for want of _Words_, a ly.
      Among _Dissemblers_, in things temporall,
      These _Raskalls_ are the ver’est _Knaves_ of all.

    Some, thinke this _Emblem_ serveth to expresse
    No more, but onely _Womens_ ficklenesse;
    And, they will most desire to have it so,
    Who, like those best, that most inconstant grow.
    Although my _Fortunes_ were, in some things, bad,
    I never in my life, experience had
    Of an _inconstant woman_: Wherefore, then,
    Should I condemne the _Females_, more than men?
      I heare some talke, that _Women_ fickle be:
    And so I thinke; and so I know are wee.
    And (being put together) say I dare,
    That, they and wee, in equall manner, share
    A _giddinesse_, and _ficklenesse_ of minde,
    More wavering, than a _Feather_, or the _Winde_.
    The _Woman_, heere, is plac’d, to typifie
    A minde distracted with much levitie:
    Not, that the womans _Wav’rings_ are the more;
    But, for this cause: Most _Vices_, heretofore,
    And _Vertues_ too, our _Ancestors_ did render,
    By words declined in the _female-gender_.
    The _winged Ball_, (whose tottering Foundation,
    Augments the causes of our _variation_)
    Meanes, here, those uselesse, and vaine _temp’rall things_,
    That come and goe, with never-staying _wings_;
    And, which (if thereupon our hearts we set)
    Make _Men_ and _Women_, the _Vertigo_ get.
      Hereafter, then, let neither _Sexe_ accuse
    Each other; but, their best endeavours use,
      To cure this _Maladie_ in one another,
      By living well, and lovingly together.

    That, whilst they breed, the fury of the seas

    And, those tumultuous _Waves_, which after that
    Began to rise, and bee enrag’d thereat,
    Were calmed so, that _Hee_ was borne in peace,
    From whom, the faithfull _Off-spring_ did encrease.

    Against the _Fortresse_ of their strong defence,
    Yet, still it stands; and, safe, it shall abide,
    Ev’n in the midst of all their foming pride.
      Vpon this _Rocke_ so place me, oh my God!
    That, whatsoever _Tempests_ bee abroad,
    I may not feare the fury of my Foe;
    Nor bee in danger of an overthrow.
    My life is full of _Stormes_; the _Waters_ roule,
    As if they meant to swallow up my soule.
    The _Tides_ oppose; the furious winds doe roare;

    A _Complement_ or two will serve the turne;
    Or, where the _kindnesse_ may required bee;
    Or, when the charge is with a trifle borne.
    It is as easie too, for him to spend
    At once, the full Revenues of a yeare,
    In Cates, for entertainment of his _Friend_,
    Who thinkes his _glorie_, is _expensive-cheere_:
    For, 'tis his pleasure; and, if none should come
    Like _fashionable-Friends_, for him to court,
    Hee would with _Rogues_, and _Canters_, fill the Roome,
    Or, such as should abuse, and flout him for’t.
      But, hard it is, to suffer, or to spend
    For him (though worthy) that’s of meane estate,
    Unlikely our occasions to befriend,
    Or, one unable to remunerate.
    Few men are liberall, whom neither _Lust_,
    _Vaine glorie_, _Prodigalitie_, nor _Pride_,
    Doth forward into foolish _Bountie_ thrust;
    As may, by Observation bee espide.
    For, when a slender _Bountie_ would relieve

    To their _Buffoone_, a Knights estate they’l give,

    The _Sword_, to bee an _Emblem_, here, we draw,
    Of that Authoritie, which keeps in awe
    Our _Countries_ Enemies; and, those that are
    The Foes of _Peace_, as well as those of _Warre_;
    That, _Peace_ may give the _Law of Armes_ her due,
    And, _Warre_, to _Civill-pow’rs_, respect may shew.
    For, _Kingdomes_, nor in _Warre_ nor _Peace_, can stand,
    Except the _Sword_ have alway some command:
    Yea, that, for which our forraine _Spoylers_ come,
    _Domesticke Foes_, will else devoure at home;
    And, _stranger-drones_ the peacefull _Bees_ will harme,
    Vnlesse with warlike stings, themselves they arme.
      Considering this, let none bee so unwise,
    The _Swords_ well-us’d protection to despise:
    Or, thinke the practice of this _double-guard_,
    In any place, or age, may well bee spar’d.
    Let not the _Sword-man_ sleight the pow’rfull _Gowne_;
    Nor _Gowne-men_ cast the _Sword_ out of their Towne,
    Because it terrifies, or draweth Blood;
    For, otherwhile Phlebotomy is good:
    And, though to kill a Lowse, the _Banians_ feare;
    (Though _Anabaptists_ love no _Sword_ to weare)
    Yet, being drawne, to fright, or cut off _Sinne_,
    It may bee brandish’d by a Cherubin.
      However, from the _Sword_ divide not you
    (In any case) the peacefull _Olive-bough_:
    That is, let _Peace_, at all times, be that _End_,
    For which, to draw the _Sword_ you doe intend;
      And, for _well-doing_, bee as ready, still,
      To give _rewards_, as _blowes_, for _doing-ill_.

    The _Spade_, for _Labour_ stands. The _Ball with wings_,
    Intendeth _flitting-rowling-wordly-things_.
    This _Altar-stone_, may serve in setting foorth,
    Things firmer, sollid, and of greater worth:
    In which, and by the _words_ inclosing these,
    You, there may read, your _Fortune_, if you please.
    If you, your _labour_, on those things bestow,
    Which _rowle_, and _flutter_, alwaies, to and fro;
    It cannot be, but, that which you obtaine,
    Must prove a _wavering_, and unconstant gaine:
    For, he that soweth _Vanitie_, shall finde,
    At _reaping-time_, no better fruit then _Winde_.
      Your houres, in serions matters, if you spend,
    Or, such, as to a lasting purpose tend,
    The purchase of your paines will ever last;
    And, bring you _Pleasure_, when the _Labour’s_ past.
    Yea, though in teares, your _Seed-time_, you imploy,
    Your _Harvest_ shall be fetched home, with ioy.
    If _much_ be wrought, much profit will ensue;
    If _little_, but a little meede is due.
    Of _nothing_, nothing comes: On _evill deedes_
    An evill conscience, and, ill fame succeedes:
    An _honest-life_, still findes prepared for’t,
    Sweet _Hopes_ in Death; and, after, _good-report_.
    Of _Sexe_, or of _Degree_, there’s no regard:
    But, as the _Labour_, such is the _reward_.
      To _worke-aright_, oh _Lord_, instruct thou mee;
    And, ground my _Workes_, and _buildings_ all on thee:

    Behold, there is a _Raine-bow_ in the _Cloud_,

    There is nor trouble, sorrow, nor distresse,

    Long _use_, or _time_, the storme away will turne,
    Else, _Patience_ makes it better to be borne.
    Yea, _sorrowes_ lowring dayes, will come and goe,
    As well as prosp’rous houres of _Sunshine_ doe;
    And, when 'tis past, the _paine_ that went before,
    Will make the following pleasure seeme the more.
    For, hee, hath promis’d, whom we may beleeve,
    His blessing, unto those that _mourne_ and _grieve_;
    And, that, though sorrow much dejects their head,
    In ev’ry need, wee shall be comforted.
      This promise I beleeve; in ev’ry griefe,
    Performe it, _Lord_, and helpe my unbeliefe:
      So, others viewing how thou cheerest mee,
      Shall, in all _sorrows_, put their trust in thee.

    From him, th’event that’s wisht for, also springs.
      This being so, how dare wee, by the _Lawes_,

    How dare wee bring a matter that’s unjust,

    For nothing, but to spoyle and murther there?

    Run rambling through the World, to kill and slay,

    Wee are, as by example, taught to see
    How fruitlesse our _Intemperancies_ bee:
    Thus by the _Rule of Contrarieties_,

      To see a nastie _Drunkard_, reele and spew,

    That’s _pictur’d_, which to _doe_, had wicked bin,
    For, though to vertuous ends; wee doe deny
    The _Doing-ill_, that _Good_ may come thereby.
      From hence, let us be taught, that carefull heed,
    Whereby wee should both _Minde_ and _Bodie_, feed.
    Let us, of our owne selves, observe the size;
    How much wee want, how little will suffize;
    And, our owne _longings_, rather leave unfill’d,
    Than suffer any portion to bee spill’d:

    Some say, (and many men doe these commend)
    That, all our _deeds_, and _Fortunes_ doe depend
    Vpon the motions of celestiall _Spheres_;
    And, on the constellations of the _Starres_.
    If this were true, the _Starres_, alone, have bin
    Prime cause of all that’s _good_, and of all _sinne_.
    And, 'twere (me thinkes) injustice to _condemne_,
    Or, give rewards to any, but to _them_.
    For, if they made mee _sinne_, why for that ill,
    Should I be damn’d, and they shine brightly, still?
    If they inforc’d my _goodnesse_, why should I
    Bee glorified for their _Pietie_?
    And, If they neither _good_ nor _ill_ constraine,
    Why then, should wee of _Destinie_ complaine?
      For, if it bee (as tis) absurd to say,
    The starres enforce us (since they still obay
    Their just _Commander_) 'twere absurder, farre,
    To say, or thinke, that God’s _Decree_ it were,
    Which did _necessitate_ the very same,
    For which, we thinke the _starres_ might merit blame.
    Hee made the _starres_ to bee an ayd unto us,
    Not (as is fondly dream’d) to helpe undoe us:
    (Much lesse, without our fault, to ruinate,
    By doome of irrecoverable _Fate_)
    And, if our good Endeavors, use wee will,
    Those glorious creatures will be helpfull still
    In all our honest wayes: For, they doe stand
    To helpe, not hinder us, in God’s command;
      And, hee not onely rules them by his pow’rs,
      But, makes their Glory, servant unto ours.

ILLVSTR. XLIIII. _Book. 4_]

    Although wee know not a more patient creature,
    Than is the _Lambe_, (or, of lesse harmfull nature)
    Yet, as this _Emblem_ shewes, when childish wrong,
    Hath troubled, and provok’d him overlong,
    Hee growes enrag’d; and makes the wanton _Boyes_,
    Bee glad to leave their sports, and run their wayes.
      Thus have I seene it with some Children fare,
    Who, when their _Parents_ too indulgent were,
    Have urg’d them, till their _Doting_ grew to _Rage_,
    And, shut them wholly from their Heritage.
    Thus, many times, a foolish man doth lose
    His faithfull Friends, and justly makes them foes.
    Thus, froward _Husbands_; and, thus, peevish _Wives_,
    Doe foole away the comfort of their lives;
    And, by abusing of a _patient-Mate_,
    Turne dearest _Love_, into the deadliest _Hate_:
    For, any wrong may better bee excused,
    Than, _Kindnesse_, long and wilfully abused.
      But, as an injur’d _Lambe_, provoked, thus,
    Well typifies how much it moveth us,
    To finde our _Patience_ wrong’d: So, let us make
    An _Emblem_ of our selves, thereby to take
    More heed, how God is moved towards them,
    That, his _long suffring_, and his _Love_ contemne.
    For, as wee somewhat have of every _Creature_,
    So, wee in us, have somewhat of his _Nature_:
    Or, if it bee not sayd _the same_ to bee,
    His _Pictures_, and his _Images_ are wee.
      Let, therefore, his _long-suffring_, well be weigh’d,
      And, keepe us, to _provoke him_, still afraid.

    It is by some supposed, that our _Owles_,
    By Day-time, are no perfect-sighted _Fowles_;
    And, that, the more you doe augment the _light_,
    The more you shall deprive them of their _sight_.
    Nor _Candles_, _Torches_, nor the _Sunne at noone_,
    Nor _Spectacles_, nor all of these in one
    Can make an _Owlet_ in the day-time see,
    Though none, by _night_, hath better eyes than shee.
      This _Emblem_, therefore, sets their _blindnesse_ forth,
    Who cannot see, when an apparant _worth_
    Illustrates vertuous Men; yet, seeme to spie
    Those faults, wherewith ill-willers them belie.
    The _blindnesse_, also, well it may declare,
    Of _Heretikes_, who Eagle-sighted are,
    In _Sophistries_, and in the cloudie-night,
    Of those darke _Errors_, which delude the _sight_;
    Yet, cannot see the Rayes of _Truth_ divine,
    Though, brighter than the _Day-light_, shee doth shine.
    It, likewise, very fitly typifies,
    Those, in our dayes, who spie out mysteries,
    Beyond the _Moone_; yet, cannot gain the view
    Of that, which common _Reason_ proveth true:
    And, therefore, onely, crie it (madly) downe,
    Because, by _Reasons_ light, it may be knowne.
      These, when 'twas offred, first, the light refused;
    And, they have now the darknesse which they chused.
    Till, therefore, God shall offer _Grace_ againe,
    Man strives to set up _Lights_, to these, in vaine:
      For, what are _Lights_ to those who _blinded_ bee?
      Or, who so _blinde_, as they that will not see?

    On doubtfull wings; and, till the _fray_ bee past,

    Which _Emblem_ serves, not onely, to expresse
    The danger, and the issues doubtfulnesse,
    In all _Contentions_; but, may warne us too,
    That, wee no strivings rashly undergoe;
    Since they, who long with painfull skill have striv’d,
    Of likely _Conquests_, are at length depriv’d.
      _Force_, much prevailes; but _Sleight_ and _Wit_ hath pow’r,
    Sometime, to hurle downe _Strength_ upon the floore.
    Sometimes againe, our _Ingineeres_ doe faile;
    And, _Blowes_, doe more than _Stratagems_, prevaile.
    Though, I, upon mine _honest-Cause_ depend,
    Another may o’rethrow it, by his _Friend_:
    And, hee that boasteth of his _Patrons_ grace,
    May lose his hopes, if Bribing come in place.
      To say the Truth, in whatsoever Cause,
    Wee by the _Sword_ contend, or by the _Lawes_,
    There’s no event or issue more assured,
    Than this, that, losse to both shall bee procured:
    And, that, sometime, as well an _innocent_,
    As _guilty-cause_, may finde an ill event.
    Let, therefore, our endeavours be, to strive,
    Who, shall hereafter, least occasion give
    Of those _contentions_, and of those _debates_,
    Which hurt our honor, safetie, or estates:

    By _grinning-dogs_, which howling roame by night,
    To satisfie their grudging appetite.
    Here, therefore, by an _Emblem_, wee are showne,
    That, _God_, (who as hee lists, bestowes his owne)
    Providing so, that none may bee unfed,
    Doth offer to the _Dogges_, the _Childrens_ bread.
      And, by this _Emblem_, wee advised are,
    Of their presumptuous boldnesse to beware,
    Who bound God’s _Mercie_; and, have shut out some
    From hope of _Grace_, before the _Night_ is come:
    Since, to the _Dogs_, his meat is not denide,
    If they _returne_, (though not till _Evening-tide_.)

    Nor have I, there, been fill’d with _Bread_ alone;
    But, on the blessed _Bodie_ of thy _Sonne_,
    My _Soule_ hath feasted. And, if thou dost grant

    This _Infant_, and this little Trusse of _Hay_,
    When they are moralized, seeme to say,
    That, _Flesh_ is but a tuft of Morning-_Grasse_,
    Both greene, and wither’d, ere the day-light passe.
    And, such we truly finde it; for, behold,
    Assoone as Man is borne, hee waxeth old,
    In Griefes, in Sorrowes, or Necessities;
    And, withers ev’ry houre, untill hee dyes:
    Now, flourishing, as _Grasse_, when it is growne,
    Straight perishing, as _Grasse_, when it is mowne.
      If, wee with other things, mans _Age_ compare,
    His _Life_ is but a _Day_ (For, equall’d are
    His _Yeares_ with _Houres_: His _Months_, with _Minutes_ bee
    Fit parallels; and, ev’ry _breathing_, wee
    May tearme a _Day_) yet, some, ev’n at the _Night_
    Of that short _Day_, are dead, and witherd quite.
    Before the _Morning_ of our lives bee done,
    The _Flesh_ oft fades: Sometime, it growes till _Noone_:
    But, there’s no mortall _Flesh_, that will abide
    Vnparched longer, than till _Evening-tide_.
    For, in it selfe, it alwayes carries that,
    Which helpeth so, it selfe to ruinate;
    That, though it feele, nor _storme_, nor scorching _flame_,
    An inbred _Canker_, will consume the same.
    Considering well, and well remembring this,
    Account the _Flesh_ no better than it is:
    Wrong not thine everlasting _Soule_, to cherish

    How fast their _Time_ departs, they best perceive,
    From whom it steales, before they take their leave,
    Of what they love; and, whose last _houre_ is gone,
    Before their chiefest businesses are done.
      How fast it slides, ev’n they are also taught,
    (Too late, perhaps) who never kept in thought
    Their _ending-day_; but, alwayes did presume,
    Or, largely hope upon the _Time to come_;
    The _present-howres_, nor thankfully enjoying,
    Nor, honestly, nor usefully employing.
      That, _yeares expir’d, are lost_, they likewise find:
    For, when their understanding brings to mind,
    How fondly (or, how ill perchance) they spent
    Their _passed age_; they see, with discontent,
    The _Time_, not onely _lost_, but, worse than so;
    _Lost_, with a thousand other Losses moe:
    And, that, when they shall need it, _wealth_ nor _pow’r_,
    Can purchase them, one _minute_ of an _howre_.
      Consider this, all ye that spend the _prime_,
    The _noone tide_, and the _twilight_ of your _Time_,
    In childish play-games, or meere worldly things;
    As if you could, at pleasure, clip _Times_ wings,
    Or turne his _Glasse_, or, had a _Life_, or twaine

    To finde what proofes they will abide:
    Yet, thinke not all thy _Trialls_ past,
    Till thou on ev’ry side art cast;
    Nor, feare thou, what may chance to thee,
    If truely, square, thy dealings be:
    For, then, what ever doth befall,
    Nor _harme_, nor _shame_, betide thee shall.

    Fine _Clothes_, faire _Words_, entising _Face_,
    With _Maskes_ of _Pietie_ and _Grace_,
    Oft, cheat you, with an outward show,
    Of that, which prooveth nothing so.
    Therefore, your _Emblems_ Morall read;
    And, ere too farre you doe proceed,
    Thinke, whom you deale withall, to day,
    Who, by faire shewes, deceive you may.

See, _Emb._ XXI.


22

    You, are accus’d of no man, here,
    As, if to any, false, you were
    In _word_, or _Deed_; and, wish, we doe,
    Your _Conscience_ may acquit you too,
    But, if your selfe you guilty finde,
    (As, unto such a fault inclin’d)
    The crime, already _past_, repent;
    And, what is yet _undone_, prevent.

See, _Emb._ XXII.


23

    You haue delighted much, of late,
    Gainst _Womens_ ficklenesse, to prate;
    As if this frailety you did find,
    Entail’d, alone, on _Womankind_:
    But, in your selfe, ther’s now and then,
    Great proofes, of wav’ring minds, in men:
    Then, jugde not faults which are unknown;
    But, rather learne to mend your owne.

See, _Emb._ XXIII.


24

    At your _Afflictions_, you repine,
    And, in all troubles, cry, and whine;
    As if, to _suffer_, brought no _Ioy_;
    But, quite, did all contents destroy.
    That, you might, therefore, _patient_ grow,
    And, learne, that Vertues pow’re, to know,
    This _Lot_, unto your view, is brought:
    Peruse, and practise what is taught.

See, _Emb._ XXIV.


25

    On out side _Friends_, thou much reli’st,
    And, _trustest_, oft, before thou try’st;
    By which, if _Cousnage_ thou escape,
    Thy _Wit_ wee praise not, but thy _Hap_:
    But, lest by _trust_, (e’re _triall due_)
    Thou, overlate, thy _Trusting_ rue;
    Observe the _Morall_ of thy _Lot_,
    And, looke that thou forget it not.

See, _Emb._ XXV.


26

    By this your _Lot_, it should appeare,
    That, you your selfe are too severe;
    Or, have, by some, perswaded bin,
    That, ev’ry _Pleasure_ is a _sinne_.
    That, wiser therefore, you may grow,
    You have an _Emblem_, now, to show,
    That, _Hee_, whose wisdome all men praise,
    Sometime, layes downe his _Bow_, and _playes_.

See, _Emb._ XXVI.


27

    Thou little heedst how _Time_ is lost,
    Or, how thine _Howres_ away doe post;
    Nor art thou mindfull of the day,
    In which thy life, will breath away.
    To thee this _Lot_, now, therefore, came,
    To make thee heedfull of the same.
    So, of thy Dutie, let it mind thee,
    That, thou maist _live_, when _Death_ shall finde thee.

See, _Emb._ XXVII.


28

    A safe-abiding, wouldst thou know,
    When _Seas_ doe rage, and _winds_ doe blow?
    If so; thine _Emblem_ shewes thee, where
    Such _Priviledges_ gained are.
    Observe it well; then, doe thy best,
    To bee a _Yongling_, in that nest
    There _Moraliz’d_; and, mocke thou not
    At what is taught thee, by this _Lot_.

See, _Emb._ XVIII.


29

    Beleeve not, alwayes, as thy _Creed_,
    That, _Love-profest_, is _Love-indeed_;
    But, their _Affections_ entertaine,
    Who in thy _need_, firme _Friends_ remaine.
    Perhaps, it much may thee concerne,
    This _Lesson_, perfectly, to learne.
    Thine _Emblems_ morall, therefore, view,
    And, get true _Friends_, by being, _true_.

See, _Emb._ XXIX.


30

    The _Consciences_, of some, afford
    No Lawfull use unto the _Sword_:
    Some dreame, that, in the time of peace,
    The practise of all _Armes_ may cease;
    And, you, perhaps, among the rest,
    With such like fancies are possest.
    However, what your _Morall_ sayes
    Observe; and, walke in blamelesse _waves_.

See, _Emb._ XXX.


31

    A better _Fortune_ you might gaine,
    If you, could take a little _paine_:
    If you have _Wealth_, you should have more,
    And, should be Rich, (though you are _poore_)
    If to the _longings_ you have had,
    A true _endevour_ you would adde:
    For, by your _Emblem_, you may see,
    Such, as your _Paines_, your _Gaines_ will be.

See, _Emb._ XXXI.


32

    When any troublous Time appeares,
    Your _Hope_ is ouercome, with _feares_,
    As, if with every _Floud_ of _Raine_,
    The _World_ would quite be drownd againe.
    But, by your _Emblem_, you shall see,
    That, _Sunshine_, after _Stormes_ may be:
    And, you this _Lot_, (it may be) drew,
    In times of neede, to comfort _you_.

See, _Emb._ XXXII.


33

    When, you to ought, pretend a right,
    You thinke to winne it by your _might_.
    Yea, by your strength, your purse or friends,
    You boast to gaine your wished _Endes_.
    But, such _Presumptions_ to prevent
    You to an _Emblem_ now are sent
    That, showes, by whom he _Victor_ growes,
    That winnes, by giving overthrowes.

See, _Emb._ XXXIII.


34

    If, truely _temperate_, thou be,
    Why should this _Lot_, be drawne by thee?
    Perhaps, thou either dost exceed,
    In costly Robes; or, drinke, or feede,
    Beyond the _meane_. If this thou finde,
    Or, know’st, in any other kinde,
    How thou offendest by _excesse_,
    Now, leave off, that _intemp’ratnesse_.

See, _Emb._ XXXIV.


35

    Thou hop’st, to climbe, to honor’d _heights_,
    Yet, wouldst not passe through stormes or _streights_;
    But, shun’st them so, as if there were
    No way to _blisse_, where _troubles_ are.
    Lest, then, thou lose thy hop’d-for praise,
    By, seeking wide, and easie wayes;
    See what thine _Emblem_ doth disclose.
    And, feare not ev’ry _winde_ that blowes.

See, _Emb._ XXXV.


36

    Sometimes, it may be, thou dost finde,
    That, God, thy _prayers_, doth not minde,
    Nor, heede, of those _Petitions_ take,
    Which, men and _Congregations_ make.
    Now, why they take so ill effect,
    Thou, by our _Morall_, maist collect:
    And, by the same, shalt also see,
    When, all thy _suits_ will granted be.

See, _Emb._ XXXVI.


37

    Thou, hast been very forward, still,
    To _punish_ those, that merit ill;
    But, thou didst never, yet, regard
    To give _Desert_, her due _Reward_.
    That, therefore, thou maist now have care,
    Of such _Injustice_, to beware,
    Thine _Emblem_, doth to thee present,
    As well _Reward_, as _punishment_.

See, _Emb._ XXXVII.


38

    Thou, either hast a _babling tongue_,
    Which, cannot keepe a _secret_, long;
    Or, shalt, perhaps, indanger’d growe,
    By such, as utter all they know.
    In one, or other, of the twaine,
    Thou maist be harm’d; and, to thy gaine,
    It may redound, when thou shalt see,
    What, now, thine _Emblem_, counsels thee.

See, _Emb._ XXXVIII.


39

    By this, thy _Lot_, we understand,
    That, somewhat, thou hast tooke in hand,
    Which, (whether, further, thou _Proceed_
    Or quite _desist_) will danger breed.
    Consider, then, what thou hast done,
    And, since the _hazzard_ is begun,
    Advised be to take the _Course_,
    Whrch may not make the danger worse.

See, _Emb._ XXXIX.


40

    The _Destinies_, thou blamest, much,
    Because, thou canst not be so rich,
    As others are: But, blame no more.
    The _Destinies_, as heretofore;
    For, if it please thee to behold,
    What, by thine _Embleme_, shall be told,
    Thou, there, shalt find, which be those _Fates_,
    That, keepe men low, in their _estates_.

See, _Emb._ XL.


41

    Thou thinkst, that thou from _faults_ art free;
    And, here, unblamed thou shalt be.
    But, if to all men, thou wilt seeme
    As faire, as in thine owne esteeme,
    Presume thou not abroad to passe,
    Vntill, by ev’ry _Looking-Glasse_,
    Which, in thy _Morall_, is exprest,
    Thou hast, both _Minde_, and _Body_ drest.

See, _Emb._ XLI.


42

    Some, _labour_ hardly, all their daies,
    In painefull-profitable wayes;
    And, others taste the sweetest _gaine_,
    Of that, for which these tooke the _paine_:
    Yet, these, they not alone undo,
    But, having _robd_, they _murther_ too.
    The wrongs of such, this _Emblem_ showes,
    That, thou mayst helpe, or pitty those.

See, _Emb._ XLII.


43

    Thou, often hast observ’d with feares,
    Th’_aspects_, and _motions_ of the _Starres_,
    As if, they threatned _Fates_ to some,
    Which, _God_ could never save them from.
    If this, thy dreaming Error be,
    Thine _Emblems_ Morall shewes to thee,
    That, _God_ restraines the _Starry-Fates_,
    And, no mans harme, _necessitates_.

See, _Emb._ XLIII.


44

    Thou, hast provoked, over long,
    Their _patience_, who neglect the wrong;
    And, thou dost little seeme to heede,
    What _harme_ it threats, if thou proceed.
    To thee, an _Emblem_, therefore, showes,
    To what, _abused-Patience_ growes.
    Observe it well; and, make thy _Peace_,
    Before to _Fury_, _Wrath_ increase.

See, _Emb._ XLIV.


45

    Thou hast the helps of _Natures_ light;
    _Experience_ too, doth ayde thy sight:
    Nay more, the _Sun_ of _Grace-divine_,
    Doth round about thee daylie shine;
    Yet, _Reasons_ eye is blind in thee,
    And, clearest _Objects_ cannot see.
    Now, from what cause, this _Blindnesse_ growes
    The _Morall_ of thine _Emblem_ showes.

See, _Emb._ XLV.


46

    Thy _cause_, thy _Money_, or thy _Friend_,
    May make thee forward to _contend_;
    And, give thee Hopes, that thy intents,
    Shall bring thee prosperous events.
    But view thy _Lot_; then, marke thou there,
    That _Victories_ uncertaine are;
    And rashly venture not on that
    Whose End may be, _thou knowest not what_.

See, _Emb._ XLVI.


47

    To them who grudgingly repine,
    Assoone as their estates decline,
    This _Lot_ pertaines; or, unto those,
    Who, when their neighbour needy growes,
    Contemne him; as if he were left,
    Of God; and, of all hopes bereft.
    If this, or that, be found in thee,
    Thou, by thy _Morall_, taught shalt be,
    That, there is none so ill besped;
    But may have hope, he shall be fed.

See, _Emb._ XLVII.


48

    Thy _Flesh_ thou lov’st, as if it were,
    The chiefest _Object_, of thy _Care_;
    And of such value, as may seeme,
    Well meriting, thy best esteeme.
    But, now, to banish that conceit,
    Thy _Lot_ an _Emblem_ brings to sight,
    Which, without flattery, shewes to thee
    Of what regard it ought to be.

See, _Emb._ XLVIII.


49

    It may suspected be, thou hast,
    Mispent the _Time_, that’s gone and past;
    For, to an _Emblem_ thou art sent,
    That’s made, such folly to prevent:
    The _morall_ heed; Repent thy _Crime_;
    And, Labour, to _Redeeme the Time_.

See, _Emb._ XLIX.


50

    With good applause thou hast begunne,
    And, well, as yet, proceedest on:
    But, e’re the _Lawrell_, thou canst weare,
    Thou to the End must _persevere_.
    And, lest this dutie, be so got,
    Thou hast a Caveat, by this _Lot_.

See, _Emb._ L.


51

    Although, this time, you drew it not,
    _Good Fortune_, for you, may be got.
    Perhaps, the _planets_ ruling now,
    Have cast no good _Aspects_ on you.
    For, many say, that, now and then,
    The _Starres_ looke angerly on men:
    Then, try your Chance againe, anon;
    For, their displeasure soone is gone.


52

    If, by your _Lot_ you had beene prais’d
    Your minde, perchance, it would have rais’d,
    Above the _meane_. Should you receive
    Some check, thereby, It would bereave
    Your _Patience_: For, but few can beare,
    _Reproofes_, which unexpected are.
    But, now prepared you have beene,
    To draw your _Lot_ once more begin;
    And, if another _Blancke_ you get,
    Attempt your _chance_, no more, as yet.


53

    To crosse your hopes, _Misfortune_ sought;
    And, by your _Lot_, a _Blanck_ hath brought:
    But, he who knew her ill intent,
    Hath made this _Blanke_ her spight prevent;
    For, if that _Number_ you shall take,
    Which these two _fignres_, backward, make,
    And view the place to which they guide;
    An _Emblem_, for you, they provide.


54

    These _Lots_ are almost _Ten_ to _One_
    Above the _Blankes_; yet, thou hast none.
    If thus thy _Fortune_ still proceed,
    Tis _Ten_ to _One_ if well thou speed.
    Yet, if thou doe not much neglect,
    To doe, as _Wisdome_ shall direct,
    It is a _Thousand_ unto _ten_
    But all thy Hopes will prosper, then.


55

    It seemes, Dame _Fortune_, doth not know,
    What _Lot_, on thee, she should bestow;
    Nor, canst thou tell, (if thou mightst have
    The choice) what _Fortune_, thou shouldst crave.
    For, _one thing_, now, thy minde requires;
    Anon, _another_ it desires.
    When Resolution thou hast got,
    Then, come againe, and draw thy _Lot_.


56

    The _Chance_, which thou obtained hast,
    Of all our _Chances_, is the last;
    And, casting up the totall _summes_,
    We finde thy _Gaine_, to _Nothing_ comes.
    Yet if it well be understood,
    This _Chance_ may chance to doe thee good;
    For, it inferres what _Portion_ shall,
    To ev’ry one, (at last) befall;
    And warnes, while _something_, is enjoyd,
    That, well it (alwaies) be imployd.

              A _Supersedeas_ to all them, whose custome
              it is, without any deserving, to importune
                   _Authors_ to give unto them their
                               _Bookes_.


    It merits nor your Anger, nor my Blame,
    That, thus I have inscrib’d this _Epigram_:
    For, they who know me, know, that, _Bookes_ thus large,
    And, fraught with _Emblems_, do augment the Charge
    Too much above my _Fortunes_, to afford
    A _Gift_ so costly, for an _Aierie-word_:
    And, I have prov’d, your _Begging-Qualitie_,
    So forward, to oppresse my _Modestie_;
    That, for my future ease, it seemeth fit,
    To take some Order, for preventing it.
    And, peradventure, other Authors may,
    Find Cause to thanke me for’t, another day.
      These many years, it hath your _Custom_ bin,
    That, when in my possession, you have seene
    A _Volume_, of mine owne, you did no more,
    But, _Aske_ and _Take_; As if you thought my store
    Encreast, without my Cost; And, that, by _Giving_,
    (Both _Paines_ and Charges too) I got my living;
    Or, that, I find the _Paper_ and the _Printing_,
    As easie to me, as the _Bookes_ Inventing.
      If, of my _Studies_, no esteeme you have,
    You, then abuse the _Courtesies_ you crave;
    And, are _Vnthankfull_. If you prize them ought,
    Why should my _Labour_, not enough be thought,
    Vnlesse, I adde _Expenses_ to my paines?
    The _Stationer_, affoords for little Gaines,
    The _Bookes_ you crave: And, He, as well as I
    Might give away, what you repine to buy:
    For, what hee _Gives_, doth onely _Mony_ Cost,
    In mine, both _Mony_, _Time_, and _Wit_ is lost.
    What I shall Give, and what I have bestow’d
    On Friends, to whom, I _Love_, or _Service_ ow’d,
    I grudge not; And, I thinke it is from them,
    Sufficient, that such _Gifts_ they do esteeme:
    Yea, and, it is a _Favour_ too, when they
    Will take these _Triflles_, my large _Dues_ to pay;
    (Or, Aske them at my hands, when I forget,
    That, I am to their _Love_, so much in debt.)
      But, this inferres not, that, I should bestow
    The like on all men, who, my _Name_ do know;
    Or, have the Face to aske: For, then, I might,
    Of _Wit_ and _Mony_, soone be begger’d, quite.
      So much, already, hath beene _Beg’d_ away,
    (For which, I neither had, nor looke for pay)
    As being valu’d at the common Rate,
    Had rais’d, _Five hundred Crownes_, in my Estate.
    Which, (if I may confesse it) signifies,
    That, I was farre more _Liberall_, than _Wise_.
      But, for the time to come, resolv’d I am,
    That, till without denyall (or just blame)
    I may of those, who _Cloth_ and _Clothes_ do make,
    (As oft as I shall need them) _Aske_, and _Take_;
    You shall no more befoole me. Therfore, _Pray_
    _Be Answer’d_; And, henceforward, keepe away.

              A _Direction_, shewing how they who are so
          _disposed_, _shall find out their =Chance=, in the
                       =Lotteries= aforegoing_.


Turne about one of the _Indexes_ in the Figures, which are in the
following Page, without casting your eyes thereupon, so observe where
it stayeth untill your hand ceaseth to give it motion. If it be the
upper _Figure_, whose _Index_ you moved; than, that _Number_ whereupon
it resteth, is the number of your _Lot_, or Blancke.

This being knowne, move the other _Index_ in like manner, and that
_Quarter_ of the said _Figure_ whereon the same standeth (when
your hand is taken away) sheweth in which of the foure Bookes, or
_Lotteries_, that _Chance_ is to be expected, whereunto your _Number_
doth send you, whether it be _Lot_, or _Blancke_. If it be any Number
above Fifty, it is a _Blancke Chance_, and you are to looke no further.
If it be any of the other _Numbers_, it sends you to the _Emblem_
answering to the same _Number_, in the _Booke_ next before the same
_Lotterie_.

If the letter _M._ be placed before the alotted _Number_; then, that
Lot is proper onely to a _Man_: If _W._ stand before it, it is proper
onely to a _Woman_: if there be no letter, it is indifferent to both
_Sexes_: And, therefore, when a _Man_ or _Woman_ happneth on a _Chance_
impertinent to their proper _Sexe_, they are then, to take the next
_Chance_ which pertaineth properly to their _Sexe_, whether it be
_Blancke_ or _Lot_; the triall whereof, I have thus contrived, without
the use of _Dice_; lest by bringing them into sight, they might,
sometimes, occasion worse _Gaming_.

      _If =King=, =Queene=, =Prince=, or any one that springs
    From Persons, knowne to be deriv’d from =Kings=,
    Shall seeke, for =Sport sake=, hence to draw their =Lot=;
    Our =Author= sayes; that, hee provided not
    For such as =those=: Because, it were too much
    For him, to find out =Fortunes=, fit for such,
    Who, (as hee thinkes) should, rather, =Ayde= supply
    For him, to mend his evill =Fortunes= by.
    To =them=, hee, therefore pleased is to give
    This noble, and this large =Prerogative=;
    That, they shall chuse from hence, what =Lots= they please,
    And make them better, if they like not =these=.
      All other =Personages=, of =High degree=,
    That, will professe our Authors friends to be,
    This =Freedome=, likewise, have; that till, they find
    A =Lot=, which is agreeing to their mind,
    They shall have libertie, anewe, to try
    Their fought-for Chance: And, ev’rytime-apply
    The =Morrals= they disliked, unto those,
    Which are, ill-quallifide, among their =Foes=.
    All others, who this =Game=, adventure will,
    Must beare their =Fortunes=, be they Good, or Ill._

seen). In these cases, consistent punctuation has been used.

A list of inconsistencies and problems found in the text:--


Introduction

Sheet 6 "A Writ of Prevention". STRVCTVRFS should probably read
